2: General Scenarios

These scenarios are not tied in to the campaigns detailed later in this document, and
are either ‘one-off’ scenarios, or else tied into Dark Horizons own campaigns.

Aliens ate my Babysitter Scenarios/aliens-ate.doc

Tied into Dark Horizons ongoing Alien Artifacts campaign material. More alien
artifacts to confuse the players - only this time they're also babysitting a noble family
as well... So when things and people start vanishing the players get more and more
nervous... Not yet written.

How Much for Just the Planet? Scenarios/How-Much.doc

Tied into Dark Horizons ‘Kelp-Blight on Aloha Centauri’ theme, the players are to
mediate a dispute between New Worlds and a client corporation over the
terraforming of a frontier planet. But New Worlds are hiding and important discovery,
and are willing to kill to protect it...

Rossi Vice Scenarnios/Rossi-Vice.doc

After a Marine dies from an overdose and another is caught peddling the drug, a
conspiracy to make Marines dependant upon the stimulant Dextramol is discovered.
The players then must break up the drug ring and destroy the production facilities on
Ross. But why is the Garp Corporation involved? The start of a new drugs-related
theme.
2: Drive-Wars Campaign Scenarios

The Drive-Wars campaign is the first in a series of three campaigns involving the
Parnell Corporation. Drive-Wars focuses on the invention of a new Jump Controller,
and Parnell’s attempts to destroy it and anyone involved with it. The revelations that
result will shake the United Worlds to its very core. Much of the build up to the finale
is detailed in the Drive-Wars document itself, and should be added to other unrelated
scenarios. Only the precis for the sequel campaign, ‘Drive-Wars II - The Return of The
Navigator’, has so far been written, and so additional sections will be added to this
document as they become available.

Welcome aboard the Marie Celeste Drive-Wars/Scenarios/Marie-Celeste.doc

When a passenger freighter is found adrift, the players investigate. But things fall to
pieces as its systems start to fail until they have an 11 hour countdown until the ship
destroys itself in an excessive DF jump. The only way to Survive is to restore the
sanity of the two remaining passngers... Introduces Jump-Drive technology.

Into the Outdoors with Gun & Camera Drive-Wars/Scenarios/Gun-&-Camera.doc

Introducing Edward Carter and his fearless (and soon to be dead) reporting team.
CMC HQ want the publicity - Tri-V wants the special on the Corps, and 5-coy get the
short end of the stick. Not yet written.

Death of a Star Drive-Wars/Scenanos/Death-of-a-Star.doc

Edward Carter is the last of his team to be assasinated, in spite of the players best
efforts to protect him. But they do obtain evidence of Parnell’s plan to destroy the
new Jump Controller being developed by Tyrell, and get access to the reporter’s ship
with the prototype device. Not yet written.

Drive-Wars Finale Drive-Wars/Drive-Wars.doc

The players go to infiltrate Tyrell’s research base, and end up in a four-way fight for
the new Jump Controller technology. If they succeed, then not only do they get the
technology, but also a lot of information of the very shady side of the Parnell
Corporation.
