### Precis

In the 25th century, all supra-light drive systems rely
on the Jump Synchronicity Enabler to raise the
performance of supra-light” drives  to useable levels.

The JSE- device is rigidly controlled by its
manufacturers, the Parnell Corporation. The
development of a new device that offers performance
increases over the JSE, yet does NOT infringe on the
patents, causes the Parnell corporation to start a
campaign to eradicate all knowledge of the new
device, as well as anybody who has come into contact
with it.

The Colonial Marine Corps find evidence of the
existence of the device when a Net reporting team
somehow manage to beat them to the scene, even
when computer records confirm that the reporters 
departed AFTER the Marines. The reporting team is
systematically murdered (by Parnell security), 
raising suspicions.

Further investigation links one of the reporters too as
fairly insignificant corporation, the Tyrell Corp, which.
specialises in obscure electronics research in the
medical field. It becomes. apparent that the reporter 
gave aid to a defecting engineer from this corporation
in return for access to a prototype device. Furthermore,
the information indicates that certain key personnel
have been moved to an unspecified facility to work on
a ’new project’, apparently the development of the new
device.

The Marines determine the planet to where the
personnel have been moved, then the. exact location of
the new facility using a device that tracks the stray
emissions of the device (determined by examining the
prototype aboard the reporters’ ship), only to arrive to
find themselves in the middie of a war between 
Parnell’s security forces, and those of the Tyrell Corp.
Finally, a third, force then arrives, also wanting the
secrets of the new device, and further complicates
matters.

### Segment 1: The Reporters

Over three or four months, a crack reporting team
consisting of Edward Carter (Front man), Stephen Park
(sound), John Finch (Camera) and Deborah Landry
(producer) somehow manage to beat the CMC to the
scene of any disturbances, even though a computer
search confirms that the team left aboard their ship a
full week AFTER the CMC ship departed.

In the following two months, each member of the team
in turn is assassinated (in the order Park, Finch,
Landry) in mysterious circumstances that could only
just barely be conceived as plausible. These murders
cannot be connected with the disturbances on which
they are reporting.

### Segment 2: The Evidence

A security team lead by Major Avo Stetto of the Parnell
Security Force attempts to covertly assassinate the
one remaining reporter, Edward Carter, and
‘appropriates’ all the video tape that they can find. In
So doing, they are disturbed by Marines, and escape
with no important casualties, but leave behind some
data disks and a video tape.

The Marines discover that the disks and the one
remaining tape contains details of both the drive and
the efforts of Parnell to hide its existence, as well as
other data which was extracted from the CMC’s own
computers using a password that is identified as
belonging to the CSM (although it in fact was his
original training code and not in current use).

Carter is mortally injured, but believes he recognises
one of his assailants as a member of the ’Sugar Mice’
mercenary unit, enhancing the paranoia, since the
CSM was once a member of the same unit, and this
information will bring his loyalties into question (at
least among the regular Marines).

Again, these events seem unconnected with the
current mission, and their significance will not be noted
until a computer search of the Ship Registry shows no
record of the reporters’ ship - in spite of the fact that
the CMC Jump-ship is locked onto it!

### Segment 3: The Tyrell Corporation

Following the leads given in the previous segment, the
Marines discover more about the Tyrell Corporation
and its personnel. A security detachment from the
Tyrell corporation ‘recovers’ the Device which was
removed from the impounded reporters’ ship and Is
currently being guarded by the CMC whilst their tech
experts attempt to discover its secrets. However, the
head of the security team is captured, and a data pack
is found on him that gives the access codes into the
Tyrell corporation computer network A hacking run
gives the Marines the data they need about the Tyrell
Corporation, the Device, and where the design facility
is located.

A Parnell plant within the Corps’ transmits this
information covertly (and may be discovered in the
process), and the Marines are ordered to get to
the Design Facility with all possible speed - using the
device if it wasn’t stolen from them.

The Marines travel to an unremarkable class-M planet >
that is nominally unaligned and supposedly of no
interest to any corporation and set up their standard
facility. Using a detector that detects the sensor 
emissions of the Device, they discover the location of
- an underground facility — abandoned since the mid-
23rd century.

They gain entry to the complex by one of the 4 main.
entrances (two of which are blocked up), and explore
the miles of underground tunnels and caverns, until
they find the Device Design Facility - hidden in the old
power-house. The Marines might even manage to
avoid the Tyrell security team assigned to the facility,
who are on roving patrol. However, their intrusion will
be detected unless special care is taken.

Whilst interrogating the design team (who. do not put
up much of a fight), the Marines discover that the
Tyrell Corporation expects security teams from both
Parnell and xxxxxxx, as well as reinforcements’ from
Tyrell, all probably arriving the following day. A guard
team is posted in the facility, and a land-line run to the
Corps base.

The following day, the facility's perimeter defence
alarm is tripped by the Parnell team’s entry into the
complex. The Tyrell team surrenders to the Marines
and ask (“for protection (hardly needed taking into
account the damage > and problems that the Parnell
team has caused the Corps in recent months) - which
is given. Almost the entire Marine force is shuttled to
the complex to defend it against the intruders.

The defence of the complex is complicated by the
arrival of the Tyrell reinforcements, and the team from
_XXXxXxXxXxx, both of which arrive during the firefight, and
gain entry through a Main entrance and a small,
disused entrance respectively. If the Marines did not
do a thorough sweep of the facility the previous day,
they may not even know of the small entrance’s
existence, and may have no warning of the intrusion
other than the arrival of the shuttle.

The Marines should prevail, capturing a number of
Parnell security, and members of the xXxxxxxxx team.
The Tyrell personnel should be _ revived, and all
research materials taken into custody.

The head of the Parnell security team, Major Avo
Stetto, should also be captured, and brought before a
military tribunal to assess his crimes. He is convicted,
and is offered his homeworld’s method of dispatch.
Stetto accepts, and commits sepuku - before the
assembled Marines immediately.

### Appendix 1: An Overview of Drive

The physics of the Jump Drive were postulated early in
the 21st century, when the Unified Field theory finally
married the nuclear forces with gravity and
electromagnetism. The Jump Drive itself operates by
opening a ‘hole’ in the fabric of space-time, causing a
Quantum tunnel between two points.

Initially, the direction and length of the tunnel with
respect to its real-space interstices was only
marginally controllable, requiring a navigation check
following each jump to determine exactly where the
ship had emerged. Later improvements on the drive
allowed small increases in the controllability of the
drive, but it was the invention of the Jump
Synchronicity Enabler by the Parnell Corporation that
opened up mans’ colonisation of space.

The Jump Synchronicity Enabler (JSE) operates by
using stellar phenomenon at the interstices, coupled
with quantum level sensors, to measure accurately the
duration of the jump, and hence the length of the
hyperspace catenary. This gives to quite a high
precision the real-space distance travelled in the
jump, and hence much reduces the’ navigational
calculations required upon emergence. With an order
of magnitude less time required to complete the
navigational checks, the JSE gave a 10 fold decrease
in the time required for any multi-;ump voyage.

The Tyrell device (provisionally titled the Jump
Navigational Device - JND) operates on an entirely
different principle. By using feedback from the Jump
Drive itself in association with sensor arrays and a
secondary field generator, the JND is able to create a
fixed-length hyperspace catenary with an accurately
known and controlable direction. By using a blind-
man’s walk method, even a pocket computer is
capable of performing the navigational calculations
required for a multi-jJump voyage with NO navigational
checks required after each Jump. A simple
reallignment is required after the voyage to re-sync
the systems, but the JND gives an overall 7-fold
increase in apparent speed over a ship equipped with
a standard Jump-Drive and JSE.

### Appendix 2 - The Reporters

#### Edward Carter

Front Man for the award winning '30-30-30' news
program, produced by the Tri-V division of Nas-corp,
Carter has an very large following throughout United
Worlds. Arrogant almost to the extreme, his reputation
is founded on a hard-hitting approach to news that
has landed Carter in trouble more than once.

#### Stephen Park

Carter’s sound man, Park specialises in all forms of
Comms tech, particularly recording devices. As such,
he has allowed Carter to record conversations that.
would otherwise be unobtainable, and always carries a
few ‘gizmos’ in a secret pocket of his equipment bag.

A man with an outrageous sense of humour, Park is an
incorrigible prankster who revels in practical jokes. His
current favorite is to bug someone’s sleeping quarters, —
then patch the output into a PA system.

#### John Finch

As Park is to sound for Carter, so is Finch for vision.
Finch, however, does not have Park’s flair. A rather
dull conversationalist, Finch has an_editic memory,
which often proves useful to the reporting team for
‘recreating documents at which he has only had a
chance to glance.

#### Deborah Landry

Landry is Carter’s producer. It is she that receives the
news tips and decides which story Carter should cover.
Although generally quiet, she is used to getting her
own way without question, and expects all and sundry
to defer to her and her team.

She always has a comm-linked computer about her
person (at last a SIPC-A), which receives news items
both from Nas-corp, and from her other sources.

It was Landry that arranged the defection of an
engineer from Tyrell, and obtained the new drive
device for the reporters’ ship. Using her contacts, she
had all trace of the ship removed from the Ship
Registry to cover the existence of the device (she isn’t
stupid, and knows that Tyrell at least will De searching
for the device - she hopes to use her prominent
position in the public eye to help protect herself). She
dies before the Marines can extract this tnformation
from her - they must deduce it from the recovered data
disks, or from data well hidden on her SIPC-A.

### Appendix 3 - The Parnell Security Force

#### Major Avo Stetto

An ex-mercenary, who went AWOL from CMC 2coy in
2487, this man commands the Parnell elite Rapid
Deployment Force (RDF). Believed to be. originally
from the planet Lumiere, he had a distinguished career
with the ‘Sugar Mice’ mercenary unit following his
departure from 2coy until the ‘Sugar Mice’ was
dissolved as the members went their separate ways.

Following this, he had operational tours in the security
forces of the Restyk, Argaran and Jefferson
corporations, in which he executed his duties’ with
uncommon valour. In the said forces, he cultivated a
reputation for putting his own safety at risk rather then
that of his men, giving rise to his nickname of
‘Maverick’.

Little is Known of his) current work with the Parnell
Corp, but it is believed that he headed up a project to
give Parnell a fighting force equal (at least) to that of
the Colonial Marines Corps, which was later assigned
to the ’Special Projects Division’ of that Company.

Following several major computer searches after the
lumiere uprisings, it was found that no CMS ident file
matches this man’s personality profile. This in itself’s a
worry to the Colonial Administration.

Combat specialities believed to include:

* Sniper (inc Camoflage & Evasion)
* Hand-to-hand
* Sabotage
* Deep-Penetration Patroling
* Airborne Insertion

### Appendix 4 - The Tyrell Corporation

No Bios available at this time.

::: callout callout-info
Notes: 

At this time, all details within this scenario-= are
provisional and subject to possible change.

Additionally, personality bios of the major NPCs need
to be further refined, as do specific events within the
story-line (mostly involving special effects).

The non-vital NPC bios have not been written yet, nor
has additional scripting for non-live (i.e. recorded and
data reported) events.

The reporters should be brought into the campaign
over as long a period as possible, ideally the Marines
should watch an episode of the news program each
day (of play) for two months before the reporter team
actually appears.
