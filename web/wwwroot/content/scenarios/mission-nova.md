### History:

Elements within Special Forces have decided they are undervalued
by the United Worlds and it is time they took what was rightfully
theirs. Anything they want.

This group has decided to take over a world on the edge of
colonised space and make in to their base. The time delay in any
messages to the UW about the take over should take so long to
get though they will have built up the planetary defenses and
taken full political control and formally break the planets ties
with the UW.

They have moved onto the planet under the pretext of an exercise
and at present are awaiting the final supplies and troops before
making their move to take over the planet.

The planet is a recently colonised planet still only in its
third generation, but is a near ideal planet with earth like
conditions and no known dangerous life forms or bacteria.

A small number of pressman have been invited on to the planet to
cover the "exercise", so when the SF's are ready the takeover
will appear legitimate to the rest of the UW making it difficult
for the UW to do anything after the event has occurred. At
present the SF control the one communication satellite around the
planet.

To pay for the supplies and various "favours the SF have a small
stashof Bodomite hidden in the deserted CMC base. Only a few of
the SF know where it is so there is less chance of treason.

One of the pressman before leaving notified his editor who has
checked up on the exercise. Some one in the UW for once on the
ball realised that something was not right and notified MI.
Further digging by them has revealed the plot.

The UW wants this attempted coup stopped quickly and quietly as
Special forces running amok is not good publicity.

5Coy gets the short draw and goes in to capture, kill and
generally frustrate the plans of the SF.

As far as the locals are concerned 5Coy are the opposition for
the exercise. 5Coy are to use the CMC base that is located in
the vicinity of where the SF base is supposed to be

Unknown to both the CMC base has been used by a drug gang to
stash drugs. The Drug Enforcement agency has found out about the
base being used and are waiting for signs of activity before
doing a raid and capturing the drug dealers.

### Friday Night

### Saturaday 

Marines dropped into hot LZ. SF attacking

Players enter base. It is unlocked

Patrols that go out are harressed. SF

Press make a number of appearances to interview Marines. They
will be complaining about their stories not getting out.

Civilans seen hanging around the base but move off if approached.

Local dignitries arrive at base for a look see. Will insist on
wandering off on their own if followed will split up.

The oldest dignitry is taken by SF

The other dignitries will return to base kicking up a fuss. Some
one should mention that he is one of the original colonist

SF turncoat comes in, saying he'll take Marines to where the
SF's are camping tonight. Will want to take just a small recon
group out as large group could scare off SF.

Once Recon group has gone with turncoat a 2nd turncoat wil come
in. Will claim to be MI and is here to warn them a false turncoat
will be coming in to lure a small group of them away to capture
and interrogate.

While that is happening the recon team is ambushed.

High Command insist release of the old man has become a proirity.

If players do not realise some one else informs them the old man
still has a tracker implanted fromwhen he first landed on the
planet and can be tracked.

Sat Night 

SF launch a reasonable attack against the base, the main effort
to kill 5Coy not take the base.

Marines chasing the intermittant signal around being harresed as
they go.

 
### Sunday

A maintenance man turns up to check out the building. He's a
desparate drug dealer trying to reclaim the hidden drugs. If
they check up on him he's not SF and not a maintenace man but
will refuse to talk.

Drug Enforcement do a Vechile raid armed mainly with pistols,
thinking Marines are the drug dealers. No one told them about a
Marine exercise.

If players get them up will conduct a serach which will reveal
drugs in one of the officers bedrooms. They will want to arrest
the people who are sleeping in the room and remove then to jail.

The supposed MI SF comes in and tells cmc about a meeting of the
SF. All the leaders will be there.

As 5Coy move out to take out this meeting the main attack on
Marine base. The leaders have told them where the Bodomite is.
They need it very shortl;y to pay off their debts and get the
final supplies.

The attack should fail, eventually and in the withdrawl the SF
will try to bring Marines out of the base so they can get in and
get the Bodomite.


IF SF get bodomite SF will be able to get of planet
iF sf don't they will be rounded up Eventually.

MI SF is a fake trying to get the Bodomite for himself ï¿½Furture
NPC ?

Need Drug Enforcement ID cards.
