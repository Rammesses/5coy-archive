## The Return of the Navigator

### Precis

The United Worlds is in a state of uproar following
charges against the Parnell Corporation for thetr
attempt to repress Knowledge of a new and superior
Jump Drive Controller, developed by the Tyrell
Corporation.

Marine raids on Parnell installations uncovered
information pointing to Vanessa Parnell herself
ordering the’ termination of 200 people, and the
attempted destruction of an entire planet.

And as the- recriminations reach their peak, the
Navigator returns...

In the earliest days following the development of the
JISE device, Parnell attempted the abitious ‘Outreach’
project. Using Jump Drives more powerful than ever
before, coupled to the (then) new JSE, the three
‘Outreach’ ships were dispatched to star systems of the
outer core. All three vanished forever, along with their
crews... Until now.

Parnell’s understanding of Jump-Space was incorrect,
and the flight programs caused the ships to make
jumps of Nuge lengths at extreme DFs. When the
Navigator’s ship emerges from Jump-Space within the
gravity well of the planet the Marines are operating on,
he ejects in an EEV and is rescued by the Marines.

The Navigator is completely blind, a white film covering
his eyes, and yet has an uncanny Knowledge of almost
any subject. He also proves to be highly precient and
able to determine his location by some unfathomable
sense.

When the Marines discover from the appropriated
Parnell files that his ship was dispatched over three
hundred years previously, and that the Navigator was
a member of the original crew, suspicions are raised.
When he also proves able to determine jump
coordinates without any mechanical aid, the Navigator
is suddenly the most valuable commodity of all, and
almost every corporation wants him for their own ends.

He is captured, retrieved, and captured again
repeatedly over a number of months, despite the
Marine’s best attempts - yet each time manages to
escape, steal a jump-ship and navigate to wherever a
the Marines happen to be. He is later captured whilst
being accompanied to CMC HQ by CSM Turner.

Turner is found aboard the drifting Jump-Ship with no
memory of events’ following the capture of the
Navigator. Even use of a truth drug reveals nothing.

Finally, in a showdown with Vanessa Parnell herself,
the Navigator demands to see Victor Parnell (the head
of Parnell at the time the ‘Outreach’ ships were
launched) himself, despite her insistence that he died
of natural Causes almost three hundred years
previously. After a series of fights, Vanessa herself kills
the Navigator, and before she can be interrogared with
a truth drug, she apparently commits suicide.

An autopsy shows she died from massive brain
hemorages, Caused by an anti-capture device
embedded in her brain - but the remains of the device
show a more sinister aspect. Vanessa was being
controlled...

A video transmission is intercepted between a much
Older Stetto, a very old Turner and someone they call
Victor intimating that the three controlled Vanessa and
executed her when she became a liability.

With split screen so you can see Turner and Stetto. These older versions of major characters are in fact the originals from which the younger Stetto (who committed Sepuku following his capture in Drive Wars), and CSM Turner were cloned.

They also discuss how much the Marines know about the
‘Outreach’ project, and the Navigator, and the older
Turner appends a video of him torturing the younger.
