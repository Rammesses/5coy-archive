(from drone.doc November 19, 1992)

### Precis

This scenario is intended to be run as one of several
that introduce elements required for the main Drive-
Wars campaign background. This scenario involves the
Marines in a_econfrontation with Tyrell and Parnell
personnel, introducing botn corporations to the
Marines (though at this stage, the importance of the
Tyrell Corporation will not be understood).

A Military high-displacement-factor jump-drone has
gone missing - it was an experimental model being
tested by the Corps. The Marines are sent to recover
it, and most importantly its in-flight data recorder, in
order to determine what went wrong.

They discover the drone, but the jump-drive module
and the data-recorder are missing - stolen by Tyrell
and Parnell respectively.

Tyrell need a jump-drive unit for comparative testing
of their new JND device - Parnell have stolen the
data-recorder in order to find out how Tyrell pulled the
drone off-course (a technique they see as having
MANY uses - imagine being able to waylay any jump-
drive powered ship!).

The Marines must resolve the situation, recover both
devices and neutralise the two threat forces, preferably
discovering some of their motivations in the process.

### Segment 1 - The Landing

The Marines land safely on the planet on the Friday
evening and set up their standard facility (if at Hesley
or Overstone or other site with buildings for main
facilities, footage of the buildings being dropped into
position should be used at the first briefing).

A burst of comms traffic (video) is intercepted - this is
a segment of a report from the Parnell team - headed
by Major Avo Stetto - to base, reporting their arrival on
the planet.

A scanner should be put into operation that will
pinpoint the drone by morning.

Standard pre-mission briefing should be taken,
including

- Planetary Data
- Drone Design/Recognition Data
- Scanner/Other Equipment Usage
- Team Selection/Command Authorisation

Several patrols should be made - two encountering
local inhabitants, and a third being involved in a short
and inconclusive skirmish with Parnell forces. One one
of the quiet patrols, explosions and gunfire are noticed
in the distance, but there is nothing to be found when
the Marines investigate.

### Segment 2 - The Drone

On the Saturday morning, after a relatively peaceful
night, the scanner gives the Marines a precise grid ref
for the drone.

Two of the three (ideally, three squads are required for
this scenario, although four may be accommodated)
squads should be sent out to recover the drone (which
will take four people to lift, even with the harness
provided). A tech mush be present, preferably NPC or
well-briefed player, to determine that:

1. The drone has been tampered” with (pretty
obvious, considering the casing is open and wires
are hanging out from where the two unitS were
located).

and

2. There is a radiation hazard due to impact damage
to the micro-pile reactor that powered the. unit,
requiring special gear from back at Base before
the drone can be handled.

Back at Base, the third squad should be on sentry duty
and at this point, two sensor traces should appear on
the scanner’s display (actually indicating the recovery
beacons for the Jump-Drive and the data-recorder -
the’ first beacon was activated by  “Tyrell’s initial
attempts to defeat the security surrounding the JSE
device on the drive, the second by the Tech at the
Drone using a remote device - this will have to be
coordinated using referee radios), and the device
starts to calculate lock coordinates for these.

One squad should return from the drone to get
Suitable anti-rad gear to recover the drone, whilst the
second guards it. When they return, this squad returns
to base for sentry duty, whilst the base squad go out to
investigate one of the beacon locations.

### Segment 3 - The Drive

A squad of Marines set out to investigate the signal of
one of the traces on the scanner screen. At the
coordinates, they meet a poorly armed and bedraggled
Tyrell force (they had a run in with Parnell the night
before, causing the commotion noted in Segment 1),
and should be easily overcome - running away rather
than standing to protect the drive. The Marines return
to base with the drive unit, as well as possible some
captured data sheets for it (Tyrell have an inside man
at Parnell, sending information on the security systems
for the JSE - this manifests itself as a set of technical
memos).

At base, the locals cause an annoyance, just by
standing around un-screened and watching (as well
as wandering thru the perimeter security screen from
time to time). One man decides he wants to join the
Corps, and tries everything in his power to be ‘useful’ -
even when he’s not - only a field recruitment will stop
his interference, and he proves useful for his local
knowledge later anyway - basically this guy is a foil for
some Marine aggression. Nick William’s character bio
is detailed in section 8

### Segment 4 - The Recorder

The local who has been drafted, has seen the drive
unit before, and tells of how he "saw dees peep' l'arst
nite, one lort of Gem has dis fing, and were runnin’
from anoder lort'. He is of course referring to the run in
the previous night between Parnell and Tyrell, and
even Knows in what direction each group went. The
Parnell group, of course, went in a direction that now
matches the bearing of the second beacon’s signal.

Knowing the strength of the Parnell team from the
local, all three squads are sent out to recover the
data-recorder (assumed, correctly, to be the source of
the signal). The usual Saturday night fire-fight ensues,
with both sides taking heavy damage. If CSM Turner is
along, he'll be distracted after a close call with the
Stetto - he’s not sure that really was Stetto, since he
believed Stetto dead just before the Sugar-Mice
disbanded, and if pressed will shrug his misgivings
off at the debriefing with litthke Comment, believing he
was mistaken.

::: callout callout-info
One of the major reasons for the Sugar-Mice mercenary unit disbanding was
the disappearance of Stetto, who was a major unifying force within the group.
:::

### Segment 5 - Who are these guys?

On the Sunday morning, the Marines should hook the
data-recorder up to their equipment (at a pinch, a
Psion will do) to do a preliminary data dump via sub-
space transmitter.

The player doing the dump should notice that the
telemetry indicates a strong localised disturbance in
the hyperspace catenary the drone was following (as
the data-recorder’s text is in nice plain(ish) English!).
The data-recorder is a military model, so also noted a
nav-beacon whilst in hyperspace - traceable to the
Tyrell Corporation’s ship which followed the drone
down - and a further one logged well after the drone’s
decent and crash landing - traceable to the Parnell
Ship.

The Marines are sent out to round up these two
groups - firefights ensue, and both Tyrell and Parnell
forces make it to their shuttles and off-planet - albeit
with casualties. The Marines now have recovered both
the jump-drive unit and the data-recorder and their
mission is complete - although questions will be asked
as to why the hostiles were allowed to get off-planet.

 
::: callout callout-info
The drone recorded the ident code from the ship’s navigation beacon, which
states the name and registry of the ship quite clearly, although few people outside
of the highest level of the Colonial Ship Registry Know about WHAT the beacons
transmit - if a player questions WHY the drone should retain such facts, it should
be revealed that the drone was a prototype surveillance device - allowing the
‘dropping in’ of the names of the corporations involved by their ships.

Note: In later games, if we require a ship to miraculously appear without being
spotted and its registry noted, we merely place a mole in the CMC and let the
corporations get wise and disable their beacons (a federal offense, of course!).
:::

### Segment 6 - Rounding Off

The Marines are debriefed, and all the’ information
discovered sorted into one (hopefully fairly) coherent
picture. Merits are awarded, the dead bagged up, etc,
etc and the drop-ship called down from the
Garavaglia? to recover the marines - the facility is
closed down ready for transport later.

The Garavaglia failed to detain either ship because
both made jumps immediately upon leaving’ the
atmosphere (in-system jump-offs are dangerous, and
So are not standard practice - after all, who wants to
end up at the bottom of a gas-giant’s gravity well?!).

Finally...

Everyone goes home!

 
::: callout callout-info
The Marine’s current main jump-ship is the Garavaglia II - just ’cos | like the
name and have referred to it in other documents!

#### Character Bios

##### Major Avo Stetto

An ex-mercenary, who went AWOL from CMC
2coy in 2487, this man commands the Parnell elite
Rapid Deployment Force (RDF). Believed to be
Originally from the planet Lumiere, he had a
distinguished career with the ‘Sugar Mice’
mercenary unit following his departure from 2coy
until the ’Sugar Mice’ was dissolved as the
members went their separate ways.

Following this, he had operational tours in the
security forces of the Restyk, Argaran and
Jefferson corporations, in which he executed his
duties with uncommon valour. In the said forces,
he cultivated a reputation for putting his own
safety at risk rather then that of his men, giving
rise to his nickname of ‘Maverick’.

Little is Known of his Current work with the Parnell
Corp, but it is believed that he headed up a
project to give Parnell a fighting force equal (at
least) to that of the Colonial Marines Corps, which
was later assigned to the ‘’Special Projects
Division’ of that Company.

Following several major computer searches after
the Lumiere uprisings, it was found that no CMS
ident file matches this man’s’ personality profile.
This in itself’s a worry to the Colonial
Administration.

Combat specialities believed to include:

- Sniper (inc Camoflage & Evasion)
- Hand-to-hand
- Sabotage
- Deep-Penetration Patrolling
- Airborne Insertion

##### Nick Williams

A local to the planet, Nick Williams has always
dreamed of becoming one of the elite - but has
never had the opportunity to leave this backwater.
When the Marines arrive to search for the drone,
he wants nothing more than to help - so he will be
noticed and accepted into the Corps. However, his
‘help’ is usually an annoyance to the Marines, who
Should end up doing anything to get him to leave
them alone! Eventually, he volunteers some
genuinely useful information and the commander
drafts him in order to "make use of his local
knowledge", though not to the extent of issuing
him with a side-arm (though he does get a military
screen). From. this point on, the few locals
encountered are much less’ surly than’ before
towards the Marines. Finally, Nick provides
important information on the location of the
Parnell camp, confirmed by the scanner, and
Should start to Decome accepted by the Marines
as he pulls his weight more and more - by the end
of the weekend, this character should either be a
regular NCP Marine, or (more likely) the character
should be offered to a regular player who's
previous character has recently bit the dust, and
who doesn’t mind playing an NPC for one game.
