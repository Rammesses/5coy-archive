### Precis

Once again, the players are in the middle of a whole
lot of corporate double-dealing. They are called in as
part of an attempt to mediate between New Worlds
and Restyk over an alleged breach of contract in the
terraforming of a Frontier world, and to both host the
negotiations and provide security for the Diplo-Corps
team. The negotiations take place on the world in
question.

After a day of heated negotiations, a member of
Restyk’s security team is found murdered, and the
allegations of assassination start to fly as the
negotiations fly apart. The players find evidence that
the murdered man had discovered something that New
Worlds were trying to nide.

Both corporate groups return to their facilities, and it is
the players’ job to mollify them and restart the talks,
and to prevent! violence between the parties.

The violence escalates, with the Marines right in the
middie (as usual), but the ulterior motive that New
Worlds eludes them, until they are ordered to place all
members of both corporate parties in custody "for their
own protection"! In a night mission, the Marines must
round up both parties - preferably without fatalities!

::: callout callout-info
Ha! As if they could manage that feat!
:::

The players investigate the New Worlds facility, and
find from documents and data packs there that the
New Worlds terraforming teams Nave discovered that
in the process of terraforming the planet, a mutated
Kelp plant, which grows at an immense rate, has
evolved in the seas near an atmosphere processor’s
cooling outlet.

::: callout callout-info
With the kelp blight still raging on Alpha Centauri, fast-crop kelp would
alleviate some of the chronic food-shortage of that world, and of those worlds
dependant upon food imports. Of course, New Worlds want to keep the plant to
themselves for a while, before ‘leasing’ the bio-form!
:::

The atmosphere processor was found to be placing
certain trace elements into the waste-water, which,
being hot (and marginally radioactive), encouraged the
evolution of the new Kelp species.

The players must now round up the New Worlds
terraforming team and add them to their delegates!

### Segment 1 - Oh No! Not again!

Friday night sees the Marines aboard the FSV
Kreyszig’s spare facility module for the situation
briefing.

The briefing officer outlines the background to New
World’s claim of irregularities in the contract with the
Restyk corporation for the terraforming of the planet
they are orbiting. Background to the negotiations is
given as is a full outline of the security arrangements
that the Marines will be instigating.

A tactical display is shown during the briefing
indicating the location where the Kreyszig has dropped
the facility module that is to be used for the
negotiations - equidistant from the two companies
own facilities.

::: callout callout-info
Or camps, depending upon how many buildings are available at the site.
:::

Terraforming on the planet is only part complete,
requiring the Marines to wear filter masks against the
dust and particles in the atmosphere, and filter
goggles to shield against dangerous frequencies in the
Star's spectrum.

::: callout callout-info
The goggles have a red gel in them so that the players get the impression that
the planet they are on orbits a Red Giant.
:::

The maximum possible exposure
time to the atmosphere is just 2 hours, and without the
goggles, a person is blinded in just 5 minutes.

::: callout callout-info
Whether this effect is permanent or not should depend on the exposure (at the
ref’s discression!)
:::

The players embark up one of the Garavaglia’s
dropships for transit to the planet.




### Segment 2 - One for You and Two for Me...

The corporate negotiation teams arrive for the
meetings, and cause trouble with their particular
requirements for security and comfort.

Each is assigned a state-room within the Marine's
facility, but each want more space (and also to be at
opposing ends of the corridor!)...

The New Worlds contingent also insist on inspecting
and approving the external security measures,
including patrol schedules and perimeter defence net
configuration.

::: callout callout-info
This request alone should start to make the players curious (and worried!)
:::

The Restyk Corporation delegation insist that the
Marines run a secure land-line from their state-room
to their facility. When the New Worlds delegate realise
that the opposition Nave a land-line (and hence
access to their own secure comms network), they insist
on one as well.’ The Marines suddenly become techs
for a day - out on the surface and exposed...

::: callout callout-info
The players might decide that they want to put data taps into the two land-
lines, so provision for this must be taken into account in the prop design. if they
do, then they’ll just get a coded data stream, which (with several Hours work) they
might just be able to decode some of the messages. Of course, if they don’t and
the equipment is available, then command’s intelligence division will be asking
questions at the debriefing!
:::

Whilst this is going on, regular security patrols must be
mounted, as well - cutting down on the Marine
resources available to host the meeting.

The negotiations begin, with the Marines having to be
very careful in their mediation to ensure that both
parties remain at the negotiation table. And that both
are provided with any refreshments that they wish.

::: callout callout-info
The NPC’s that play the roles of the corporates will have a field day at this
point - causing the players immense trouble!
:::

Throughout the negotiations, each side will
occasionally send a runner to their state-room to send
communiques via their comms networks.

### Segment 3 - Murder Most Foul...

During the negotiations, the Retsyk prime-delegate
call one of their security team’ to the table and pass
him a message to be send on the secure comms-net.

::: callout callout-info
2 Both security teams are lounging around when not accompanying Marine
patrols or handling secure communications for the delegates. Generally, the
Marines should be very jealous when they see what a cushy number the security
teams are onto!!!
:::

When he hasn’t returned 20 minutes later, the prime-
delegate details two more security men to find him.
They discover him dead at the comm-net terminal
and raise the alarm. The RestykK corporation
immediately blame New Worlds for the murder, calling
off the meeting and insisting that all the New Worlds
personell be arrested.

::: callout callout-info
The man has a slit throat with appropriate gory make-up to faze the players!
:::

An appropriate uproar ensues, with the Marines trying
desperately to prevent hostilities from erupting. Finally,
both delegations leave the facility, to return to their
own. The Marines escort them from the facility, but
both insist that the Marines turn back before they
reach the corporations’ bases.

::: callout callout-info
This enhances the paranoia - the players should be really worried about just
what the corporations have to hide - and what exact/y they are up to!
:::

The Marines are expected to perform the investigation
into the murder. Then they discover the evidence that
the security agent had gained access to data on the
restricted New Worlds comms-net.

::: callout callout-info
If the Marines thought to put in a data intercept on the land-lines, then what
little data that they can decode also points to New Worlds being up to something.
:::

### Segment 4 - When it hits the fan...

More and more accusatory messages fly between
Restyk and New Worlds, until a New Worlds patrol is
ambushed by Restyk. The Marines catch the tail end of
the conflict, just in time to be shot at by both sides!

The Marines return to base to lick their wounds and
regroup as orders to take all members’ of both
delegations into progressive custody.

In a night mission, the Marines have to work in two
separate teams to round up both groups. But each
also has a team out in the field, complicating matters.

The usual Saturday night firefight ensues with these
rogue teams, until (hopefully) the Marines capture all
of them after a three-way fight.

The Marines loose some of the New Worlds group in
the confusion, but this is not discovered until after the
operation when the personell tallies are checked. A
sweep is performed to check that they were not left
behind unconscious, but they don’t find them.

### Segment 5 - The Truth... and Nothing But...

In the morning, the Marines are sent to the New
Worlds facility to investigate.

In the process, they discover the secret that New
Worlds was hiding - the existence of the new kelp
Strain. They also discover that an Evac-Beacon has
been set off by the remaining New Worlds executives
to bring down a shuttle from their ship.

The Marines have to get to them before they can get
off-planet. If they don’t, then questions will be asked!

However, even if they don't capture the executives,
then at least they shoulq have discovered the
information about New Worlds cover-up of both
effluent-caused mutations and the existence of such a
potentially priceless food source from the United
Worlds (when the corporate code of practice states
that such discoveries should be reported to the
CEPA and the CAB).

::: callout callout-info
Which was admittedly written by the corporations themselves, and so contains
enough loopholes to drive a shuttlebus through. However, as this wasn’t a
planned result of genetic experimentation, New Worlds cannot claim the patent.
:::

::: callout callout-info
CEPA - Colonial Environmental Protection Agency - a (mostly) independent body
monitoring planetary environmental issues.

::: callout callout-info
CAB - Colonial Agricultural Beaureau
:::

### Segment 6 - All’s Well?

The Marines return to base, and a drop-ship arrives to
take away the two corporate teams. The Marines
should have a little trouble with moving these people,
but if they loose one, then it’s their own fault!

Once the corporates are off-planet and en-route to
the secure cells in the weapons module of the
Garavaglia Il, a debrief is held.

This should outline the whole situation for the Marines
(assuming that they missed bits on the way through).
Bodies are bagged up, commendations given and the
Marines ship out, closing up the Facility and calling

both the Kreyszig and a dropship down to recover the
facility and themselves.
