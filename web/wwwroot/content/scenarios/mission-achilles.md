### HISTORY:

Professor Brewitt fairly soon after the nuclear explosions and
resulting seismic problems on Groombridge, came up with a plan to
calm the planets core down. Once submitted it was fairly quickly
rejected as too dangerous. 

Since then tests on the planets core has been found to be
building up unbelievable pressures. The scientific community is
fairly certain that within ten years unless action is taken the
planet will explode.

As a result Professor Brewitt re�submitted his plan. This time
it was decided to be the only plan that had a realistic chance
of succeeding.

The plan did need the backing of the UW council, as it involved
the use of two nuclear devices, which were of course banned
after the Colonial War. There were groups within the UW Council
who were oppose to the plan and as a result the plan attracted a
lot of media coverage.  

It was decided that two corps of marines would be sent onto the
planet.                                                          

1st coy to clear the area of any remaining inhabitants and act   
as peace control, as "NO NUKES"  "ENVIRO FIRST" and "BAN THE
BOMB" are expected to protest on planet as well as the media.
These groups are relatively harmless.

5th coy will be working alongside the scientists and techs ,
guarding the nukes and collecting the data.

It was decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to  
get 5 coy some much needed good publicity, the media would be
able to see 5 coy in action ,see the extensive training programme
and put to rest all the past indiscretions.

### RECENT HISTORY UNKNOWN TO PLAYERS

2 weeks before 5 coy land on planet,1st coy are set down on
planet. Because of the previous explosion insect life and any
previous bacteria,diseases have reached epidemic proportions
this would not have proved a problem if everyone had adhered
to the strict safety procedures.

However Sgt Knights a keen amateur Botanist discovered a rare
and beautiful plant outside the safe area,in a momentary lapse
of reason he removed his gloves and helmet in order to view and
handle the specimen this was enough to allow bacteria to enter
his body, the bacteria affected the behavior part of his brain.
Sgt knights then went back to the base and passed the bacteria
onto the rest of the marines, fortunately for 5 coy the
contagious period only lasts four days after which the bacteria lies
dormant in the brain until triggered off. The trigger is any high
levels of stress, it will cause the affected person to employ the
"fight or flight "mechanism. Because of the marines extensive
training they will fight every time,they will then unable to
remember what they have done,to the point that truth drugs or lie 
detectors would not be able to tell the difference.

1st coy have already murdered over fifty people since landing on
groombridge,they are convinced that the bodies are the result of 
an underground terrorist group on the planet, as all the bodies
have clearly died of IR.

### FRIDAY NIGHT

5 coy land on planet ,are briefed fully on the mission by
scientists and the C.O. They then meet 1st coy ,who will be
dressed the same, boots polished,wearing shades etc.

They don't drink, swear, smoke or do anything unhealthy or
pleasurable. They will drive 5 coy mad with their constant
drills, emergency exercises, keep fit classes etc. At some point
they will mention their fears of terrorist forces on planet.

### SATURDAY MORNING

Breakfast                 

Recruits go off to do basic training

Most of 5 coy leave with 1st coy to do a sweep of the surrounding
area and search for the "terrorists".Scouts should make a
detailed record of the surrounding area ,whilst doing this they 
will come across a group of protestors, group will chant and
attach themselves to the marines, but will be non aggressive
or violent.Someone from 5 coy will explain that they are only
surveying the local area. Protestors will begin to disperse
.1st coy will start to threaten protestors and then open fire.
5 coy will hopefully try to stop them, 1st coy will then open
fire upon them.

When it looks like enough damage has been done 1st coy will then
collapse.5 coy will place 1st coy under arrest,and escort them
back to base. 1st coy will protest their innocence but will
comply with all orders.

Marines will then take blood tests to establish what they are
suffering from.(finding the bacteria that caused the condition
can be as complicated and as drawn out as we deem necessary
Could use plague problem).

1st coy will be shipped off planet which will leave the marines
sort of men so any of 1st coy wishing to remain as marines can
come back as reinforcements.

LUNCH

Unfortunately the "peaceful protestors were non too pleased at
having been attacked and have been in touch with their H,Q
who have sent down the more violent elements. These people will
be heavily armed, anything goes in the name of peace.  They will
try to sabotage all attempts the marines make to survey the
planet.Lots of chems and various other nasties will be used as
these will have been saved from other "jobs".

Marines will continue to survey the planet in the afternoon
and will come under constant fire, abuse and chem attacks as well
as interference from the press,and the peace protestors.
Nuke suits will become damaged so Decam will need to take place
on a fairly regular basis.

#### WANDERING MONSTERS

If things get quiet:

* News team accusing the marines of shooting "innocents"
  want story on 1st coy etc
* small child / mother and baby found outside "safe area"
  begging to be put out of misery, obviously suffering badly from
  radiation sickness ,but will marines do it or not?
* peace protestors , the genuine ones acting same as before
* commanding officer from 1st coy wanting to know what 5 coy did to
  his men!

* If any of the marines look bored there is lots of data that
  needs putting on disk.{ could be arranged to crash a few times}
* radiation levels need checking on all marines re�entering the
  building.


### SATURDAY EVENING 

TEA

By now the marines will have decided which areas are most
suitable for the nukes.

so after organizing them selves into two squads including techs
and scientists will leave base [ MARK AND TINK WILL NEED TO
ATTACH THEMSELVES TO GROUP "A" OR MEET THEM AT SITE . NO FX
TEAM NEED TO BE WITH GROUP "B"]

The violent element will have worked out the nuke sites and
will have booby trapped the immediate area. Hopefully one of the
marines will discover this quite early on , so as well as being 
under constant fire the marines will also have to move very
cautiously, combing the area for trip wires etc.

Group "a" will manage to get into position and set their nuke, 
and set of the "minimal distance " timer.

Meanwhile group "a" will have also have got in position as well
, but one of the scientists has discovered that the "mole" is
missing and also one of the techs.

["mole" is the device that drives the nuke underground to a set
distance before it detonates, both moles are "one offs " designed
for this mission , there commercial value is high]

Having searched the immediate area as well as they can in the
poor light , the marines will abort the mission.

Marines return to base still under fire and being harassed by
other groups.

### SUNDAY MORNING

BREAKFAST

The marines will get a lot of stick from the scientists and H.Q.
Harris will be threatened with court martial, imprisonment etc as
he was personally responsible for the success of the mission.

Also time is running away as the chain reaction of the first
nuke will begin in ** hours.countdown will start as soon as time
in starts.

Marines will be sent out in squads to search for missing person
and equipment.[ as usual they will be under attack from
extremists, peace protestors , news team etc.]

One squad will stumble across signalling device and intercept 
it and return it to base. The signalling device needs to be de�coded before the marines can discover the pick up point and
location of the "mole" and the tech.

Time ticks forever onward:

The marines will be put in a win or lose situation:

A] crack code and set nuke off 
B] crack code but run out of time 
C] don't succeed in cracking code

Whatever happens they must leave the planet 45 minutes before
the chain reaction takes place.If they do succeed setting of the
second nuke will not be delayed by other groups as they will have
had to leave planet earlier, unless the terrorists that 1st coy
spoke off do really exist!!

## MONSTERS

1st COY 

made up of a mixture of players and monster crew
