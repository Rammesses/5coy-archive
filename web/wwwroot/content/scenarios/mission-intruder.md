### FEBRUARY '96 - OAK LODGE: THRIFT WOOD

GEMS (Genetically Engineered Marines)

### Long Term Background:

In 2440-49 Restyk Corp. and CMC Special Forces cooperated on a
top secret project (codename GEMSTONE) to develop through
genetics a soldier that would be immune to IR and the toxins that
could be used on the battlefield. Combined with the intelligence
to handle modern weapon systems and the aggression to be good
soldiers. 

The project had limited success and in 2448 a company of the Gems
was produced for testing. It was found that they were not immune
but highly resistant to IR, H/R. The main problem was there was a
severe lack of aggression amongst the GEMs. Further testing of
them discovered they could become aggressive but it was
uncontrollable rages that developed not the cold, calculating
aggression that was needed in a soldier. Unknown at this time
the GEM's also had a much expanded life span 

The UW council in early 2449 was made aware of the GEMSTONE
project and  immediately closed the project down as the prospect
of IR immune soldiers going into uncontrollable rages raised the
prospect of projectile weapons coming back in to use and the
devastation that would bring with it.

All records of the project were impounded and destroyed. The
Special Forces units involved were split up and sworn to secrecy.
Restyk was forced to allow UW investigators in to destroy all
their records and were warned of massive financial penalties if
the story leaked out.

The only problem left for the UW was how to dispose of the
company of GEMs that had been produced and were now being held
in a secure military prison.

Fortunately for the UW the planet Main, a backwater planet that
was a member of the UW wanted to stop any visitors. The planet's
population had found religion and didn't want nonbelievers
corrupting them. The GEMs were willing to take up religion to
leave the prison and so a deal was struck with the planet Main
taking the GEM's and the UW in effect stopping any one going to
Main, except the occasional visit from a UW representative, by
refusing visas, dropping Main from official records.

The GEM project was forgotten about and the GEM's settled into
life on the planet.

Restyk and the Special Forces did not allow the project to die so
easily and kept the project going but buried it very deep so
discovery by the UW was not possible. 

### Recent History:

The GEMSTONE project has developed since being forced underground
has made progress and the scientists now need the original GEM's
for the genetic information they carry and to see what effects
time has had on them. Unfortunately for them the location of the
GEMs was lost to Special Forces and Restyk and was referred to
as "HomeWorld".

A recent raid on a secret Special Forces base unearthed records
to do with the GEMSTONE project and made clear that they were
looking for " HomeWorld". It also showed that the project had
not died in 2449 but had continued and very large sums of money
were involved.

The records did not make it clear whether Home World had been
discovered yet and a decision was made to get there before
Corporation or Special Forces did and remove any of the Gem's
that were still alive, and finally kill off this project.

The search for the files on Project Gemstone involved some one
who was working for Restyk, and when the planet Main was revealed
as Home World this was immediacy passed this on to Restyk.

The information was sold to Banodyne Inc. before the clerk
selling the information was picked up. The UW realising what he
had done immediately sent in a Company of Marines to recover any
of the GEM's that were still alive.

The government on Main was contacted and told/asked to get the
GEM's together for collection on the planet. The Main government
agreed and specified a small town to meet the GEM's.

The corporations have not been slow and have sent in teams to try
to persuade or snatch the GEMs. Restyk have reacted fastest and
have a number of teams on planet trying to trace the GEMs. They
have found out the town the GEMs are living in and are all
heading that way, but it will be a while before all the teams
can assemble. Banodyne has had less time to prepare and their
team is behind the marines.

Unknown to both Corporations within their teams are members of
the Puritans who have no intention of allowing any live GEMs to
leave the planet and preferably no dead ones either.
The Banodyne team has no orders to snatch the GEM's only offer
them whatever they want to come and work for Banodyne, they do
have orders to stop Restyk taking the GEMs though. The Restyk
team has similar orders but if they cannot be persuaded to
take them by force. The Restyk team has no idea about Banodyne's
presence but do know the CMC are due on planet soon.

### Friday Night:

The marines are briefed that they are to go to the planet Main
to collect  a group of OLD MEN  aged between 67 and 80 that are
being hunted by various corporation as they have top secret
information, which though old, it is vital that no one gets hold
of it. The government of Main has agreed to make these men
available and the marines are to drop to a small town where a
meeting hall has been made available for the marines. The old men
are to be taken in to protective custody and there names relayed
to the G2. When all the men have been accounted for either the
men themselfs or death certificates a drop ship will return to
collect the old men and the marines.

The marines are warned that it believed that the corporation are
now aware of the location of the men (the planet at least) and
this is the reason that the marines are going down immediately.

The Marines will also be warned that they are to be on good
behavior as there is an old agreement that the UW would avoid
sending personal on to the planet, as they have deeply held
religious beliefs and do not like unbelievers

After preparation the Marines are dropped onto the planet near
to the base.

On arrival at the base they are meet by a small group of locals
who will apologise profusely but say some one must of got it all
wrong and the "Gems"or Old Men???? are not here and most of them
have died any way the others have moved away and we have no idea
where.

One of the locals (Bill Armstrong) will get a marine to one side
and tell him that the unnatural creatures are nearby, hiding till
the marines have gone. They must not leave till these demon spawn
are removed so to stop the defilement of this holy planet.

If the other locals are challenged on this they will claim the
informer is mad and should not be believed and in the morning the
marines must leave the planet as they are defiling it. They will
bring proof of the deaths of the men.

### Saturday:

1. The G2 reports into the marines and informs them that a during
the night a drop ship got past them and seems to have landed
near to there position but the G2's sensors cannot pick it up on
planet. The marines are to find the GEMs and arrest them.

2. Some locals seen carrying boxes, who will try to avoid CMC. If
caught will claim going out for picnic/ camping trip. If followed
will just circle around as they will have seen marines and will
not lead CMC to the GEMs.

3. The Bill Armstrong is seen talking to some military types�
also seen giving them a young child who seems unwilling to go
with them.

4. A group of locals (actually the GEMs) who will claim to be
just out for a walk, but when seen are operating in a military
style.

5. One of the GEMs come into the base in a berserk rage seemingly
unaffected by IR weapons till he drops. When interrogated will
apologise for his rage but claim he thought the CMC had kidnapped
his child to force him to come into the marines. Will request to
be let go to find the people who have his child. He will refuse
to say where the others in his group are. If pushed very hard
could fly into another rage. During the interrogation will be
very mild mannered and constantly apologise for everything till
he loses his temper.

6. Bill Armstrong tries to sneak into the base to tell the CMC
that the creatures they are after like the demons that they are
the spawn of do not age and if the Marines fail to remove them
then God will have to take a hand in their removal etc. If
questioned on the earlier sighting will den it completely and
utterly.

7. A patrol comes across Restyk team who will try to talk to the
CMC to persuade them to come with them, as they can offer a
better deal than the UW and the marines that have been sent down
to kidnap them. If the marines go along with this the Restyk
will want to disarm them. They will fight if necessary.

8. More locals seen same as encounter 2.

9. Sounds of gunfire followed by a scream, either near patrol or
base, when CMC investigate find a body of a GEM who has had has
throat slit.

10. While CMC are looking at body and dealing with it a large
group of armed GEMs appear, when seeing the body go berserk and
attack the marines. Most if not all should escape.

11. The Banodyne team appear and know who the marines are. They
will insist that they have as much right to be on Main as the
CMC, and the GEM's are legally human not clones and therefore
property and have the right to choose who to go with and when,
and the CMC cannot stop them. (If Mexal is seen one of the group
will make some sort of comment about impure marines.

12. The G2 will if called up will admit technically they are
right. The UW Council is going to have to be contacted to clarify
the situation, but carry on as ordered for the moment.

13. Locals who support the GEMs attack the CMC only armed with
pistols and mix of civy and military screens. If any with civy
screens go down they will die. Any prisoners will claim to be
driving the nonnbelivers off the holy planet of Main.

14. The Restyk team seen struggling to contain a man, when CMC
seen a fire fight immediately develops, the man should escape but
if caught by marines not a disaster.

15. Locals turn up asking why the CMC are still on planet
desecrating the very ground they are walking on, they have sent
copies of the death certificates to the G2. They will get quite
agitated about the cmc and the other nonbelievers that are in
this area. The G2 will deny receiving the death certificates.

16. A small group of the Banodyne team collar the locals as they
leave thinking they are the GEMs and get into an argument with
them.

17. A mixed group of Restyk and Banodyne forces (Purists) attack
the CMC when Mexal is out on patrol on guard duty outside the
base.

18. A couple of GEMs come into the base to give themselfs up,
they will claim the troops running about are endangering their
friends in the local population. They will claim all the other
GEMs have died over the years.


19. The G2 calls down to base and informs CMC that 2 dropships
have been detected, it has no ID transponder and appears to be
coming in to their areas. Estimated landing location xxxxxx.

20. CMC ambush the dropship with a team of Purists that are�j    �coming to help the others already on planet.

21. The Banodyne team turn up with a beaten up member of their
team. They tell the CMC that the prisoner is a member of the
Purists and has been working with members of the Restyk team.
They don't have any of the GEMs but do have the child of one of
them. The prisoner has admitted that he knows where the Restyk
are camped and holding the girl. Shouldn't the CMC do their job
and go and rescue her. Its not their job to uphold the law,
they have other things to do tonight. They will then leave
leaving behind the beaten man for the CMC to deal with as they
see fit.

22. The CMC go to the location beaten out of the Banodyne man and
find the camp with the kidnapped girl in it. The Restyk team
will not give her up willingly. Once rescued the girl makes life
difficult for the marines delaying there return to base.

23. A group of GEMs seeing the kidnapped girl with the CMC assume
the worst and lose their tempers and try to "rescue" her except
they are more concerned with taking out the CMC. The girl should
end up with the CMC but not make it easy for them.


### SUNDAY

24. The girls father if still held, he will tell CMC that he's
willing to go and get the GEM's, and could they look after his
daughter while he's gone.

25. The locals turn up and tell CMC in no uncertain terms that
today is a holy day and they are not to leave the confines of the
base during the day.

26. The base is attacked by badly armed locals as soon as the CMC
try to leave the base. They were trying to enforce the locals
orders not leave the base on holy day.

27. A GEM comes into view being chased by the Restyk team, who
shot him down in sight of CMC and then proceed to try and drag
him away. Up to the CMC as to whether they succeed.

28. Locals turn up to insist the CMC must stay in the base and
the planetary government is being informed of the CMC refusal to
do as told.

29. G2 contacts CMC during encounter 28 to tell CO planetary
government is making fuss about their presence, but the UW has
declared that the CMC are authorized to take any actions needed
to regain the GEMs, who have been declared in the same legal
domain as clones and are property not humans. The GEMs must be
recovered or their bodies accounted for. 
The corporations are to leave planet immediately and failure will
be considered contempt of court for the personal involved and
the corporation as a whole.

30. After the locals have left the Press arrive. They know
something is going on here but don't know what. Yet!

31. While Press is in base the Banodyne team turn up for a nose
round and too see if the CMC have any of the GEMs. If told of
the UW Order will argue the case but in the end say they will
leave.

32. The GEM father returns to the base and tells the CMC that he
has seen the others or what is left of them, as group of madman
have been butchering them. Deal with them and they will come in.
They know where they are camped.

33. Take out the Purists camp, mixed Banodyne, Restyk and
survivors from last nights shuttle defending to the death, one
GEM being tortured in the base.

34. The GEMs come into the base telling CMC that the UW will
treat them as human's so they give up so to avoid any more
bloodshed on all sides. Father emotional goodbye to his daughter.

35. The CMC have the remaining GEMs when a call comes down from
the G2. The UW has decided that the property is to be disposed
off as the risk of the press and corporations getting hold of
them once they've left the planet is too high. 5Coy is to deal
with it now and dispose of the remains and then leave Main
immediately.

### Main Groups:
