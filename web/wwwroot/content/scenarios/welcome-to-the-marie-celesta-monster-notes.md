WELCOME TO THE "MARIE CELESTE"

### MONSTER TEAM PLOT BACKGROUND

This should be read in conjunction with the original plot outline
and the attached timeline.

The event is designed for a higher than usual player to player
roleplay element and will require the players to work as a team
if they are going to survive.

As the computers form a large part of the plotline and are
running in real time. Certain elements of the plot are fixed in
time terms, notably sunday morning so we have to stick to the
timeline we can adjust start time but once the programmes are
running that’s it!!!.

### FRIDAY NIGHT

BOREDOM ON A LONG SPACE VOYAGE

None of the known long term NPC’s are on board so any interaction
will be with crew members (Fleet.. YUCK!!!!). their has always
been rivalry between the marines and the fleet. and the
opportunity should be taken to heighten that.

Apart from that we run courses and encourage the role play.

### SATURDAY

YOUR MORNING CALL SIR & HAVE A NICE DAY! !!!

#### NPC’s

* SHIPS COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER (With players)
* TYRELL CORP EXEC (To be found on board the MC)
* TYRELL CORP COMPUTER TECH (To be found on board the MC)

::: callout callout-info
These two characters are central to the players survival when
found they are ‘off with the fairies’ but car be stabilised if
the players find and retrieve the right drugs.
:::

#### MONSTER CREW

* DEAD..... Crew and passengers from either JUMP TRAUMA OR VIOLENCE

* ALIVE & MAD IN VARYING DEGREES
  CREW, PASSENGERS, they will be.. catatonic/hysterical/ friendly
  but all will be dangerous however they are MOSTLY!!! unarmed.

* MERCENARIES

  They are being deported after a failed company raid. They have
  a higher tolerance to Jump trauma so they are deranged but
  functional, and they are ARMED having broken into the ships arms
  locker.

* ANDROID GUARDS

  Guarding the high security store. It/they can only operate in a
  restricted area but are not open to argument and is/are well
  armed and want re answers to the questions that it/they ask
  or will open fire

#### WHY CAN'T WE USE TORCHES

Just before the first tean goes on board the ships officer who is
is going with the players is called to the bridge.

He returns and tells the players that some kind of active scanner
system is in operation on board that appears to detect
Electromagnetic radiation sources and compares what it sees with
what it expects to find onboard and if the two don't match
activates a defence system, , but they cant tell what.. 
’So no torches in their come on hand them over......'. 
A supply of light sticks are issued (limited) and the. players
start to board.

### MAIN PLOT LINES

The MARIE CELESTE is ownea by Hainsworthy Space Lines, a wholly a
owned subsidiary of the TYRELL CORP it has been fitted with a
very new and experimental drive and control system. PROBLEM the |
ss system is unstable!! Massive Jump drive trauma has affected the
crew and passengers sending most mad or killing them!!

The survivors then started fighting amongst. then selves in the
a process badly damaging the ship (parts of the ship are open to
vacuum and or radiated) the players will have to enter 
contaminated areas.

The mercenaries on poard are ‘more tolerant: to the effects of the
trauma they are mad but functional and they want OUT. Some
escaped on an EEV but it failed. Their is one EEV left, it only
officially holds 12 people and the players will find out later
that IT is the. only way off the ship and it could be faulty! 

The ships control systens have other ideas. The arrival of the
marines and the use of power to open the airlock creates a power
spike and trips the control systems into operation. Automatically
starting the pre jump sequences (sealing airlocks and engaging
the exterior collision systems, causing the Caravaglia to have
to move away) and as an added bonus the drive system is set to
lethal levels and the system is counting down to jump.

So the Players have 18 hours to disable the control systems and
escape.

EASY...... 'NO way’

Firstly they only have access to the control system via the Engineering
officers terminals and they have to find his office and because of the 
modifications to the ship the deck plans are not quite right.
 
When they find his office guess what ... not control systems but
PAC MAN & SPACE INVADERS so they need to find the engineering
systems boot DISC and fast.

When they find it and having got the systems back on line they
find all changes have been locked out and the security code has
been set to a level that only a company exec would have.

So now they need the passenger list to see if any company people
were on board and then hope that they are alive and at least
partly sane. they find the passenger list sub system on the
computer but no data (the purser has that and his office is in
a radiation area) so if and when they finally retrieve the disc
it is partially corrupted.

But They are in luck, the bit they can read says that a company
area manager and a controls systems tech were aboard (they have
meet him but when they tried to help him he ran away).

So the hunt is on, eventually they do find the company men but
they are unstable! can the medics do anything?. A partial
printout of the cargo manifest shows that the ship was carrying
medical supplies.

So now they need to access the cargo list, but the link to the
cargo computer is broken which means that a patrol must go to the
cargo office and access the computer.

They find the office and the computer is ok but it has 2000+
items of cargo logged!!. When they finally find the medical
shipment what they want is there, but it is in the high security
storage area and the only person with the access codes to that
area was the skipper and it has an android guard system with an
attitude problen.

Just as they are about to go and check the storage area out the
mercenaries attack and in the confusion the company exec
disappears

By now the players are having a really bad time. They now have
to get the drugs, hold onto the tech, retrieve the company exec,
get the tech and the exec back from never land, access the
control systems, avoid the mercenaries, unlock the airlock bay,
get to the EEV, avoid the mercenaries and get off the **..*@@x
ship!!!! and time is running out.

They now have about 15 things to do all at once and they will be
split up around the ship and very venerable.

The team who go to the security area not only have to deal with
the guards but someone has wrecked the access panel, so they will
have to run a bypass.

The team searching for the exec have to avoid running into to
many mercenaries and or risk losing the exec again, a third team
should be trying to secure an escape route to the EEV bay Whilst
the fourth team guard the computer area....

The mercenaries will now have worked out that the marines have
a way off the ship and will do anything to grab that opportunity
for themselves..

SO if the players get the company men stable and get into the
systems, they will at first think that they can shut of the drive
systems and bring the Caravaglia in to tidy up this mess.

But at the very last minute the system takes back control and the
final pre - launch countdown starts, the airlock bay is however
open and the last chance for survival is to get to it as fast as
possible.

However the mercenaries have the same idea and the race for the
EEV is a fighting withdrawal, hopefully the marines make it and
all cram in (on the way on board they will have passed the EEV
and know that it only has proper space for 12 people we will have

to assess the results of overloading during some kind of time
freeze).

The EEV ejects at 4G and the Marie Celeste blows its self into
cosmic dust and throws the EEV off into deep space. and a warning

light starts to flash on the control panel!!! Will the Caravaglia
get to them in time???????.

### PLAYERS ARMS AND EQUIPMENT

The Caravaglia is on its way back to marine HQ after a major
refit and so is not fully armed or manned.

The marines are on the way back from leave and therefore are not
fully equipped.

When sent aboard the Marie Celeste they will have been issued
military side arms and screens (all that’s available), a full set
of drugs and the limited supply of lightsticks.

They will may be able to acquire some better weapons when on
board the Marie Celeste, the mercenaries did not grab all of them
and they may be able to find more lightsticks.

Food and water will not be a problem.
