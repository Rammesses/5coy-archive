### Precis:

The Marines are in transit to their next mission when
they discover a ship drifting close to them following
emergence from a hyper-jump. Investivating, they find
the ship mostly deserted, with indications that the crew
went insane and killed each other.

Only two survived. The rest of the ship is populated
only with droids. But some of these are a guard-robot
model guarding a shipment of reactor fuel
components.

The Marines must discover what happened before the
derelict ships computers make another jump. But
stopping the jump process isn't easy...'
 
::: callout callout-info
As this scenario is meant to be an inter-mission event, no specific details are
given of the corporation or the two survivors. The scenario is part of the Drive-
Wars campaign only in that it imparts technical info the the players about FTL
travel and its problems. Some of this would be scripted into convesations between
the Techs and the Commanding Officers.

If the game is moving too fast, then the running battles between the Marines and
the Robots could be complicated with the appearance of a group of Marines who
were aboard the derelict in transit back from ieave, and who are now quite insane
(checked Gingham dresses, army boots and cute furry glove-puppets, anyone?!).

Overall, this scenario should have the feel of ALIEN’, mixed with just a little "Dark
Star’ - the players should be terrified of what’s around the corner until they’ve
dealt with it when they see how fooled they’ve been!
 
The scenario would work best with about 30 Marines at maximum - less would
enhance the paranoia, but this number would make the expenditure on sets,
costumes, props, etc more worthwhile. It might be possible to develope some of
the props for prior games, and then bring them all together for this scenario.
:::

### Segment 1: Anyone got a pack of cards?

The Marines are aboard the Garavaglia Il in transit to
their next mission. A basic briefing is carried out,
describing the 3 week transit time, and general details
about their destination.

The they players are left to their own devices -
watching old vids, playing cards, running training
courses, etc. By early on Saturday morning, they
should be rather bored (although inter-character
tensions will probably be entertainingly high).

Throughout this period, the ship performs a number of
hyper-jumps, along with all the pallaver required to
manage these. This is a good time to introduce some
of the mechanics of FTL travel to the players.

::: callout callout-info
A constanly running video showing a starfield when in normal space, and a
Lyapunov space whilst jumping with a clock as overlay would set the scene well. A
voice over of appropriate PA messages from the command crew (such as "All
hands: 30 seconds to jump") would complete the illusion. A video is best used so
as not to tie up the computers, aliowing the players access to them for
‘simulations’ (games to you and I!!l).
:::

### Segement 2: There's Something out there...

Following an otherwise normal and uneventful hyper-
jump, all hell should break loose in the control room as
the proximity sensors detect the presence of another
ship very close by?- about 100kKm or so.

::: callout callout-info
At this point the starfield/Lyapunov-space video should be replaced with one
showing appropriate scans, again with the audio track containing appropriate
messages from the Con.
:::

A sensor scan‘ reveals that the ship is intact ana
under power, but that life-signs readings are
inconclusive. A check of the ships registry against the
CSR database reveals that the ship is a small
passenger freighter Owned by <xX-Corp>, that
departed Munro 8 weeks previously on a ‘bunny-hop’
run to Proxima Centauri. It should Nave arrived at its
destination in 3 days time, but is currently about 10
weeks out at its (Supposedly) leisurely DF of O.4.

::: callout callout-info
The sensor scan would be implemented as a slideshow on the player
computer, initiated by the players themselves.
:::

::: callout callout-info
Colonial Ship Registry. This information could be given later as part of a
transmission recieved from CHQ - possibly another video - and requiring the
players to send a message of inquiry back to CHQ at this point, introducing the
computer messaging system. With the reply, a file of information would be made
available for the players. If they are all on the Marie-Celeste, then this could be
downloaded to the MC’s computer (once they’ve gotten access to it).
:::

The Garavaglia move in closer and attaches using its
docking umbilicus. 

::: callout callout-info
A video of the G2 moving in close and attaching could be run here to give the
players more of the feeling that they are on a real ship.
:::

The Marines are sent over to
investigate (preferably the initial squad being forced to
use full enviro-suits)’. They find the ship very quiet,
with no sign of the 230 complement of crew and
passengers.

::: callout callout-info
A small scanner prop could be used here by the first squad of Marines to test
the atmosphere and environment.
:::

A further search discovers three bodies in the control
room, and evidence in the security log that, for some
reason, most of the passengers and crew were
attending a party in the largest area of the ship - the
hold -when the access hatches were blown off using
the emergency reiease system, with the usual
results®.

::: callout callout-info
An audio tape of the blow-out and a static security camera shot of the empty
hold and gaping hatchway would set the right atmosphere here. The security log
could be a video of the final events in the control room, if time on the Friday night
permitted shooting the footage.
:::

Further events of insanity are recorded, ending with
the suicide of the bridge crew.

In the control room itself, most of the panels have
been blased away when the bridge crew suicided, with
only a few left Operational or even in one piece. 

::: callout callout-info
Just enough, in fact for the players to get the information they need and to
simulate the systems needed for the rest of the scenario.
:::

One display shows that most of the ship is now
uninhabitable - being open to the vacuum of space
following the blow-out in the hold.

::: callout callout-info
This of course is to be abie to limit the players to the space available within the
site, and not have them expecting to be able to wander around a 200m long
starfreighter at will!
:::

### Segment 3 - Apone... Any of your people in D-block?

The techs are brought over from the Garavaglia and
get to work on decoding the computer system.

::: callout callout-info
And, of course, any of the players that hadn’t already gone over!
:::

The main computer is found to have been reconfigured
to only run pac-man (even restarting the game
automatically if someone knows how to reset an
Amiga, of course). The players find the location of the
Ship’s comp-tech’s cabin, and have to search it for the
information (and the disk) required to bring the
computer back to normal. During this hunt throughout
the ship, auxiliary lighting fails when a Marine gets the
jitters and fries the contents of a weapons cabinet,
taking a power node out at the same time. The players
are plunged into darkness to complete the search.

::: callout callout-info
It is fairly likely that a player could be made jittery enough to stage this event.
Otherwise, an NPC could be used, or else a box sparks out impressively for no
apparent reason (who said there had to be reason in this?!). Either way, from this
point on, the players should have to use torches (What? They didn’t bring any?!)
to explore the ship.
::: 

They manage to bring the internal scan back online (it
had been reconfigured to play pac-man) and it
immediately starts registering a pair life-signs within
the ship that are NOT the Marines's.

::: callout callout-info
The scan would be a program on one of the MC’s computers, started by the
players using information found in the comp-tech’s cabin.
:::

Another hunt in the dark ensues, with the players
running into the robot sentrys for the first time. If the
players are VERY good they might find out about the
fissionable materials that two of the robots are
guarding - and should start worrying about radiation
dosages!

They finally find two bedraggled passengers curled up
In a storage cabinet. Both are quite insane and swing
from being almost comatose to hyperactive and
paranoid in a matter of minutes.

### Segment 4: Don't Touch That Dial!!!

The techs are hard pushed to repair the main ships
systems, and when they bring the lighting back online
in the control room, a short triggers the computer to
resume its transit sequence - set to jump in about 11
hours time (when the computer finishes sorting out its
nav-fix).

::: callout callout-info
The best way to simulate this would be to have the players find a large wall-
box, containing (apparently) the power-circuit trips (switches and flashing lights
that signal to the FX crew to put the lights back onl).
:::

::: callout callout-info
This would either be simulated using a small innocuous window that pops up
on the computer screen, or else another computer running a simulation driving
the main monitor. Either way, this countdown should start the players really
worrying, particularly if they find nice inviting controls to stop the sequence only to
be repeatedly told that "All Changes Are Locked Out".
:::

A check of the computer reveals that it is set to make a
short jump, but with a lethal DF of 0.82'S. Worse, the
systems interlocks have locked off the access ports
prior to the jump (a standard safety measure)'’. The
players are now faced with a time limit Defore pain,
insanity and almost certain death...

::: callout callout-info
If the players don’t realise that a DF of 0.82 is lethal, then the captain of the
Garavaglia Il can tell them over the radio (or using a video link to the control room
monitor if this has been set up - needed if a vid transmission from CHQ is used to
tell the players about the ship they’re on (and showing some schematics)).
:::

::: callout callout-info
If a control panel (or panels) have been build for the airlock, then they too
must include some way for the FX crew to disable them so the players can’t get
out!
:::

The techs try desperately to access the computers
command systems, but fail. They do discover that one
of the two passengers found alive has a high place
within the corporation that owns the ship - enough to
have a master access code. But how can they bring
him back to sanity?

::: callout callout-info
A full passenger manifest would be provided, forcing the players to sift through
200 or so entries to find just who the survivors are.
:::

By pure fluke, the ship has a number of shipments of
drugs aboard in its smalier holds, one of which
includes a powerful mood stabiliser.

::: callout callout-info
The Med-Techs should have been given a briefing on 20 or 30 new drugs on
the Friday night, and it’s up to them to work out which one, find that they haven’t
got any, then find out that a consignment is on board from the cargo manifest (of
about 1000 items!).
:::

Once the Marines have discovered this fact, they must
again search throughout the ship to find the drugs. Of
course, the drugs are in the same hold as the reactor
fuel components, and the players Nave to either
overcome the guard-robots (not an easy task), or else
use spurious logic to persuade them to grant access.

Of course, the Marines don’t have the proper
documentation to be able to just ASK!

After retrieving the mood stabiliser and administering it
to the executive, the players can get him to use his
access code to overide the access-port lockout-° and
escape the ship just in time to watch it rip itself to
pieces attempting a 0.8 DF jump.

::: callout callout-info
The NPC executive logging into the MC computer system will allow him to run
a new simulation, releasing the Airlock so they can escape.
:::

If the players don’t sort things out in time, then the
captain of the Garavaglia Ii will be forced to cast off
and move out to 10000k Km 5 minutes before the Marie-
Celeste tries to jump.
 
::: callout callout-info
A final SFX video would be used here, possibly overlaying a tactical display
over the explosion from the start of Star Trek VI.
:::

::: callout callout-info
If any players are left on board the MC, then a video of the hastily departing
G2 would perfectly round off a very bad day for them! This would run
simultaneously with one on the G2 (assuming some, but not ail, players got off),
and the comms rigs would allow the two groups to talk right up to the last moment
when a jamming signal would have to be set up.
:::

### Segment 5: Is there anybody left?

A debrief if held for those who escaped the derelict,
including some interesting facts on High-DF-induced
insanity gained from the transmitted logs.

Messages to inform next of kin are sent and the
Garavaglia II continues on its journey...
