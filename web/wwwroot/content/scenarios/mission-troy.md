### Background:

On the planet Lumiere a high ranking member of the UW council
has called together the various leaders of the different factions
involved in the arguments about Puritism, to try to come to some
sort of compromise or at the least a working arrangement.
Included amongst the delegates are politicians, corporate
leaders, and scientists.

The host of this meeting, Majare Pakin is known to be in sympathy
with Puritans aims if not their methods.
 
To act as security whilst the conference is on 2Coy have been
drafted in to supplement the personal security forces of Ms
Pakin and the body guards most of the delegates have brought.

The conference is to be held in an underground complex owned by
Ms Pakin that is situated on a small island a reasonable distance
from any civilization.

Ms Parnel who is to attend the conference in consultation with
Col Svenson and Military Intelligence has decided that this
meeting is such a tempting target for various terrorist groups
that a 2nd company of marines would be useful to have around.
5Coy get nominated.
Unfortunately no one remembered to tell Ms Pakin or the CO of
2Coy that another company of marines are to attend till the last
moment.

The result of this is the security passes for access into the
underground complex for 5Coy will not be ready in time and the
nearest base is a couple of minutes away in a dropship.

### What's Going On:

The background information is basically true with a few extras
and a couple of major lies.

Ms Pakin is not only a sympathizer, but an active supporter of
the Puritan movement. The conferences real purpose is if the
movement does not get what it wants though talking, all the
leaders of their opposition will be in one place and easily
assassinated. The shift in power within the UW this would cause
would be more than enough to ensure the Puritan's would in
effect rule the UW.

To ensure the assignation attempt is successful and blame cannot
be attached several ploys have been used.
 
1. The CO of 2Coy Major Ranklin is a member of the Puritans and
    is heavly involved in the plot.
2. A PASU (Puritan Active Service Unit) has been placed on the
    island, before the preliminary security sweeps.
3. A report was "leaked" to Military Intelligence that the
    Brotherhood had heard of this meeting and where planning an
    attack.

Unfortunately the third ploy has backfired with the inclusion of
5Coy in security.

Unknown to the plotters the Brotherhood has heard of the meeting
and has decided it is a target worth trying to take out.

### Fiday Night:

1. As Time in is called Major Ranklin stalks into the camp/base
accompanied by two burly well armed marines.. He is very angry
and upset. He's just been told by HQ that he is to share the
guarding of the island with 5Coy. The fact HE is in overall
command is no reassurance, if HQ thinks his men aren't up
to it they should say so. 5Coy is to stay out of his way and
his men. He then storms out of the camp/base.

2. Ms Parnel and bodyguards turns up shortly after Major Ranklin
has left to warn the CO that the CO of 2Coy has only just been
told of 5Coy presence and is not to amused, but has been left in
overall command of security. Ms Parnel will explain what is
happening on the island and why 5Coy will be unable to use the
underground complex.

3. A two man unit form 2Coy try an infiltration/sniper attack
on the camp/base. If caught they will have the correct ID and
if necessary a radio call will confirm their ID and some one sent
out to collect them. They just thought they would see just how
good The 5Coy actually is.

TIME OUT

### Saturday Morning

4. Early morning radio call.. MI has a report that a Brotherhood
attack is due imminently on the island and 5Coy presence is
wanted NOW on the island.

The first group of marines to get to the island will be met by
Major Ranklin who will give the senior ranking man a map and be
told what areas to patrol and not to go into certain areas as
his men will be there and may well fire on anything they are not
expecting.

When 5Coy start patrolling they will come across a 4 man
Brotherhood team coming onto the island, armed with heavy
weapons and demolition charges and equipment. At the same time
in the distance where 2Coy are operating explosions are heard.

5. As 5coy head back to their drop ship or where the explosion
came from they will come across Ranklin and his men who claim
they dealt with the main attack and killed 12 members of the
Brotherhood. As the Brotherhood attack has now been dealt with
5Coy can go back to base have breakfast and PISS OFF.

Breakfast

6. Radio message from Parnel. 5Coy is to continue patrolling
the island and Major Ranklin has been told.

7. Whilst on patrol they will come across two of the delegates
J Douglas and R VEER who are walking along talking in hushed
voices, they who will have their ID's and will reasonable
friendly but fairly distant towards the marines. Once they have
shown their ID's will carry on walking.

8. Either while encounter 7 with another patrol or fairly soon
after 7 they walk into another two delegates. K Davis and P
Klaus are also walking along talking in hushed voices. They will
start off fairly friendly but if they realise the marines are
with 5Coy will become more antagonistic and obviously know and
side with Major Ranklin.

9. A small group 3-4 people mucking around making a certain
amount of noise. One of them won't have their ID, but the
others will vouch for him. If necessary one of them will
disappear to get the missing ID. This group are cooks from the
complex just getting some air. 

10. R Veer and P Klaus are seen in distance having an argument.
If the Marines fail to intervene Klaus floors Veer and storms
off. As the marines get there from cover another man emerges,
Yaks, Veers bodyguard. He had orders not to interfere, and will
help Veer up and move off.

11. A four man patrol from 2Coy who are just on patrol, they
are friendly and will chat briefly before moving off as Ranklin
doesn't want them talking to 5Coy.

12. A four man patrol from 2 Coy who are on patrol but will
"accidentally" open fire on 5Coy. They will apologize but it is
obviously false and will be very unfriendly towards Marines.
They will seem to resent 5Coy presence as much as Major Ranklin.

Lunch

### Saturday Afternoon:

13. Immediately after lunch another radio message to warn of a
brotherhood attack. The encounter goes as for encounter 4. The
major difference being this time the four Brotherhood members
are actually members of 2Coy. one of them lost his screen and
died. If the marines are being very cautious the 2Coy marines
will need to initiate the firefight.

14. Ranklin, Parnel, and Majare Pakin then up on the scene of
the dead marine. Parnel will introduce Pakin while Ranklin looks
around, on seeing the dead marine Ranklin will go ballistic.
Shouting at pakin and Parnel that 5Coy will have to go as he
will not work with them any longer. Parnel will shout him down
insisting 5Coy are staying. Ranklin will then storm off. Pakin
will run after him shouting "its too late too walk away now".
Ranklin will just walk off. If asked what she means, its too
late now she'll claim she's talking about the security measures.
Parnel will tell marines to take over patrolling the entire
island now.

15. Sniper attacks on the patrolling marines. No one should be
caught. This would be members of 2Coy involved in the plot.

16. In a very hurried radio message Parnel wants a meeting with
the CO of 5Coy at a certain location.
When the CO arrives Parnel and her bodyguard will be waiting
nervously. She will inform the CO that the conference is not
going very well at all. All sides are starting to make threats at
each other. She wants 5Coy on the island in force from now on
ready to either intervene or get her and her friends away if it
starts getting really ugly.
She will then hurry off before she's missed

17. sniper attacks on the patrolling marines. no one should be
caught but the attacks should be a little more determined.

17. (opt) A patrol comes across a small unit of PASU trying to
blow their way into the complex.

18. Full scale attack buy the Brotherhood. If it can be arranged
so that a marine patrol see's some getting onto the island and
has time to call for reinforcements before marines attack. They
could be setting up a base. In the attack a couple of prisoners
should be taken.

19. the interrogation of the prisoners.
The two Brotherhood members will reveal a number of facts:
 * They are new recruits to the Brotherhood and were recruited
     on Lumiere. This was to be their first mission.
 * The total number of Brotherhood engaged on this mission
     against the island is xx (the total number of brotherhood
     dealt with +1)
 * They know there are no units in immediate area.
 * They don't know how the unit commander found out about the
     island, but it was in the past two days.
 * They launched their big attack as they knew 2Coy had pulled
     out and hoped to catch 5Coy still off guard.
 * The attack this morning was part of their unit.
 * Why they attacked was so many tempting targets was just too
     good a chance to miss, even if it was a trap. 

20. Radio message from HQ... They have had a report there are
no more Brotherhood members operating in the area. This is from
a 100% accurate source.

21. More sniper attacks. More than one sniper should be used so
the marines should get the idea it's not the missing Brotherhood
member.

22. (opt) A marine patrol comes across Parnel and  another
delegate Mr Jakee talking quietly. If marines stop them as Ms
Parnel hands over her ID she will slip a piece of paper to the
marines. The two will then move off.

23. The marines manage to track down one of the snipers to his
base. When the Marines attack there are 4 heavly armed members
of the PASU. They have no ID's, but have Brotherhood scarves
with a note on them saying " Wear if any chance of being seen".
They also have a map with the location of the main PASU base
marked, with notes.

Tea

24. If the marines try to contact the island at all the radio
man on the island will just say the talks have reached a critical
stage and no calls are being taken for anyone, there will just
have to wait.

25. The marines attack the main PASU base which should be well
hidden and a number of the approaches mined and the others
guarded. Once the marines have taken the base there are signs it
has been used for reasonable amount of time. (well hidden, maybe
some evidence of 2Coy's involvement ?).

### Sunday Morning

26. Just before or after Breakfast the members of 2Coy not
involved in the plot launch an attack against 5Coy base. One
2Coy marine must be captured the rest are killed, escape or
refuse to talk to 5Coy.

The prisoner will tell 5Coy.
 "The Major told us you were plotting to kill the delegates at
  the conference this morning, which is why you caused so much
  trouble yesterday. The Major has gone to help the delegates
  escape before you get there. We were sent to delay you."

If further questioned he is unsure how many men from 2Coy went
with the Major,(around the number of monsters. But he does know
most of the senior NCO's went with him.

27.The marines carry out a sweep of the island, all they find
   is two bodies, whose ID's show them to be bodyguards.

28. Towards the end of the sweep a call from HQ comes from a Lt
Col Rue, ordering 5Coy off the island and back to base. Any
argument will cause Rue to suspend the CO and replace him with
the next officer in the chain of command with orders to place
the ex�CO under arrest pending a court martial.

30. Back at base Lt Col Rue is waiting/arrives to see the CO.
Whilst he is questioning the CO a call comes in from Parnel.
Saying something along the lines of ..It's all gone wrong. Come
and help us, I'll meet you at xxxx,xxxx as soon as possible.

31. As marines arrive back on island at coordinates they see Ms
Parnel being dragged away by Ranklin.

32. The marines attack the location where 2Coy are disposing
of the Councilmembers. 2Coy and the delegates involved in the
plot fight to the death.
Once battle is over Parnel will tell Marines how many missing
plotters are left free on the island.

33. Col Svenson calls in from the marines base to tell them Lt
Col Rue is under arrest and depending on time the marines can
hunt down missing plotters or return to base and leave it to
another company.

### Other Encounters:

* Meeting other Delegates wandering around the island.
* Meeting bodyguards on and off duty.
* Meeting the PASU Sat morn, before they realise that 5Coy are
  also on island. They would refer all questions to "Your Major"

### Notes:

##### Radio communication:

To HQ:
Relatively friendly and helpful till encounter 14. their contact
will be Col Svenson After that it will take longer to get replies
and in general will be less helpful and unlikely to give any
information. Their contact will have become Major Chateman.
Svenson is busy elsewhere. After encounter 27 Lt Col Rue takes
over until Col Svenson takes over.

To Island Complex:
In general it will be receptionist type who will always say who
ever they are calling is busy in a meeting.

To 2Coy:
Generally Ranklin will always be too busy to talk to 5Coy,
unless he wants to. Of course regretfully all their messages
will fail to get to him.

##### The Note from Ms Parnel:
 
To .....
From things I've overheard and the attitude of the Pro�Puritan
delegates there is a hidden agenda going on.I think there must
be some supporters on the island. I don't think there in the
complex, but my men are still checking. Be ready.
             Ms Parnel

### History

once more colony ships didn't arrive the crew of the first ship
took control of the colony and quickly the colony turned from a
sort of democracy to a slave and master system.

 The upper class of Hal are aware of their history in general
terms but they and their forebears have made sure the slaves
think they came to this planet as slaves.

 In 2466 a researcher found the lost records and a scout ship
was sent to see if the colony had survived. When the scout ship
landed the crew was immediately seized and taken prisoner. The UW
negotiator on�board was able to open negations with the planet
rulers and get the scout ship and crew released. 

 The planetary rulers refused to join the UW, but did sign the
treaty on the banning of projectile weapons in return for a
large consignment of weapons and screens. The only contact with
the rest of the universe that the planetary rulers will allow is
a small enclave at the capital city.

 Fairly quickly the UW realised that Hal was being run on a
slave economy, but the large size of the army meant that the cost
of forcing the issue would be to high, financial and political,
so the UW decided to wait. Since Hal would not join the UW there
was no need to publicise the planet and especially the way it ran
its affairs, as this could force the issue within the UW.

### Recent History:

To try to bring the slavery to an end and the planet into the UW
it was decided to build a relationship with a number of the
senators who seemed favourable to the UW.

Since the scout ship landed the slaves on planet have become
restless and a rebellion has been building. The UW has been
unable to get in contact with them. Little is known about them
as the planet rulers will not even admit to there exsistence.

In recent years one senator, Detta Francis, emerged as the
strongest senator who was in favour of the UW. In the past
couple of years his plan for overthrowing the goverment have
been coming to fruition and is nearly ready.
