The letters home were written by Megan Robertson's character, Tech-Sergeant Mexal, 
as her way of recording the games she played. 

Her character was the first Coed'Arianese "elf" to join the Colonial Marines, and Megan's character would send these letters home to her elder after each game. They
also gave the game writers a whole new raft of possibilties for corporations to get
up to their usual mischief - this time based on intel gleaned from her letters - as
is shown by the in-character prefaces to each.
