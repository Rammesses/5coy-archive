# TOP SECRET

Report Filed by: Turner, J. OCdt. TJ121710

### Mission Background


The CMC were asked for assistance to “help control riots” which erupted after the Baron
Lukel, the hereditary ruler of the planet Sirius died under mysterious circumstances. The
request was sent by the late-Baron’s brother, Roger DeSignieur who also indicated his
intention to succeed to the throne, in spite of the line of succession falling to the late-
Baron’s daughter, who was at university off-world.

A second message was also received from a member of the late-Baron’s staff indicating
that the planet was experiencing problems with the terraforming process and the
atmosphere processor in particular. This message was cut off at source and contact
with the staffer could not be re-established - instead Roger DeSignieur responded
insisting that the person was hysterical and that no problem existed. New Worlds Inc

stated that the processor had been working perfectly for 12 years and had been
throttled back into a “stabilising” mode. A UW science team was dispatched with 5-Coy
to investigate the problem.

##### Mission Objectives:

- To support the UW science team
- To ensure the terms of the new ruler’s succession are obeyed.

##### Command Staff:

* Calvin, A. Captain
* Turner, J. Acting 2nd Lieutenant
* CMO: Dibbley, D. Sergeant (Medical)

##### Casualties:

* Martins, J. Acting Sergeant
* Woe, Marine

##### Operational Structure:

Operational structure consisted on two tactical squads (Alpha and Bravo) of nominally 5
men led by Lt Turner and Sgt Beck, with a command team (Hotel) at base. A single
recruit, Maz, was assigned to this operation, and was integrated with the operational
units. Doctor Floyd, the UW scientific adviser, was attached to Hotel, to be attached to
the operational units as required, and was issued with CMC overalls and screen so that
his movements would be more covert.

##### Rules of Engagement:

The initial Rules of Engagement specified for the operation applying from 15/03/96 were
(Ops/ROE-001):

- The use of force is to be viewed as a last resort
- Force may only be used in self defense or defense of citizens of a UW
member or allied government.
- A challenge must be made before the use of force, unless it appears that
to do so would increase the likelihood of friendly casualties.
- The force employed is to be the minimum required to remove the threat,
up to and including lethal force if and only if it is necessary.

##### Hostile Forces:

**DeWitt Mining**

DeWitt operated a mining operation adjacent to the operational area and conducted
perimeter and fighting patrols within the operational area. They had a well-armed, well
trained fighting force with large numbers but tended to operate in small 4-man patrols.

**Garp Corporation**

Garp Corporation operated a manufacturing plant adjacent to the operational area.
Their security forces were known to be on planet, but were not identified in any
encounter.

**“Night Hawks” Units**

A paramilitary secret police force, under the immediate command of Nasco and working
for DeSignieur, this unit used terror tactics to cow the local populous and were
responsible for the slaughter of the late-Baron’s staff. Their close association with
Nasco also hints at Puritan links.

**Nasco**

Ex-CMC Colonel Nasco was known to assosciate with DeWitt - it is likely that he was
responsible for at least some of the DeWitt forces as well as his own “Night Hawks”.
Nasco was responsible for the attempted genocide of the Urthankoi on Altair-4 as well
as use of projectile weapons on Sirentia-2.

**Roger DeSignieur’s Security Forces**

A less-well armed but well motivated group, responsible primarily for the direct security
of DeSignieur. Believed to be trained and led by Farquar.

**Farquar**

Well-known to the CMC, Clifford J. Farquar is a gun-for-hire that always has his fingers
in more pies than he should. Always polite and urbane, he is concerned for his own
safety and advancement over all else - and always in preference over his current
employer.

##### Neutral / Friendly Units:

**“Viper” & Local Insurgents**

“Viper” was a local rebel leader who took the historic title and coordinated rebel cells
over a wide area. Apparently a good leader, her forces were fairly well armed, but
lacked discipline and training.

**Civilians**

Non-combatant civilians mostly avoided the operational area. Those that were
encountered were all terrified of DeSignieur and his “Night Hawks”.

##### Planetary Conditions:

Planetary conditions were mainly good throughout the operation, with clear skies and
temperatures of 2-10°C. The atmosphere was unpleasant, but sustainable, with the
exception of the negO2 pockets (see RED/Occ-12).

### Mission: Day 0 - 15/03/96

Prior to the Garavaglia’s jump into the Sirius system for insertion, Col Svjenson gave a
briefing covering the mission orders and the background. In addition to the information
presented above, he noted the following.

What little information was available about Roger DeSignieur indicated that he was a
volatile and unpredictable person.

Sirius itself is a privately owned planet, and only an associate member of the UW. As
such, 5-Coy were on-planet at the request of the government, and as such had no
legislative right to conduct operations. Command staff were warned that attempts by the
government or DeSignieur to usurpt the company's chain of command were likely.

The population of Sirius consists primarily (95%) of indentured servants, and has been
in uprising since 2492. The planetary government's record is marginal, so the UW would
probably support a new government once it had been established.

At the same time, the latest issue of CNN Newsline was released to the Marines, and
included additional background (see cross-reference above).

### Mission: Day 1 - 16/02/96

The unit was dropped on-planet in two waves at 1040 hours, DZ being at grid
55183429. After the post-drop rally, the whole company patrolled in along the ground-
car access route to the base provided by the Sirius government at grid 55353443. The
equipment drop had been on target and the base was quickly cleared and occupied.
During the check, two civilians were found hiding in the base. A stag rota was started
and the OPS centre set up.

The two civilians, Sara and John , were interviewed by Cpt Calvin, and claimed they
were staff of the late Baron, and were hiding from DeSignieur’s secret police force,
known as the “Night Hawks’. They also said that DeSignieur appeared to be
systematically exterminating all the late Baron's staff, however lowly their position. Cpt
Calvin noted that they did not seem to be part of any rebellion group.

At 1110 hours, the base was visited by Clifford J Farquar acting as “security advisor” to
DeSignieur to evaluate the base security for a forthcoming visit by DeSignieur. He also
delivered a set of New Worlds Inc atmospheric monitoring cards, which were issued to
all personnel. After he left, a standing order was made that no marine should refer to
DeSignieur as “Baron” as to do so would imply partisanship with the illegal succession.

Immediately afterwards (1120 hours), a civilian female approached the base. Alpha
Squad was on stag at the time, and Sgt Beck reported that she was hysterical - saying
that her companion had fallen over choking and begging for medical assistance. Beck
then took Dibbley to the site (grid 55453442) with Ricottannini and Fugazi as support.
The civilian male was dead when they arrived, and when it was noticed that the
casualty’s monitoring card had changed colour, Doctor Floyd was brought up to
investigate. He took samples, stating that the casualty appeared to have suffocated.
The body was buried and the unit returned to base. Doctor Floyd began an analysis of
the samples.

At 1230 hours, a Colonel Macbeth of the Sirian Defence forces arrived and performed
what he described as a “preliminary visit” prior to DeSignieur’s inspection. This
appeared to be an exercise in control, testing our response to commands from
DeSignieur’s forces. He was able to find only minor problems with the state of the
company.

Sara and John left the base immediately after the visit, obviously terrified by the
impending visit by DeSignieur, and unsatisfied that the CMC would protect them.

Doctor Floyd filed his analysis at 1242 hours, and requested immediate voice comms
with Surgeon-Command Mimiannapandawawa aboard the G2. His findings indicated
that there was no visible cause of death other than the normal indications of annoxia,
there were no outward physical signs, and the casualty’s airways were clear. The colour
change on the monitoring card’s universal indicator strip suggested that there might be
an unnatural component in the atmospheric make up, and that due to this speculative
component “standard issue atmosphere purification units may be non-supportive.” This
was unfortunately to be bourn out later.

At 1315, Roger DeSignieur arrived for his “inspection” of the company. He was
accompanied by a small security force, armed with heavy weapons and late-model
military screens (identified as the “Y’ model by Sgt Beck), and also by Farquar.

DeSignieur inspected the formed up company, finding nothing of consequence. Then,
however, two members of his security force burst in, dragging Sara, the female civilian
that had been hiding in the base when we arrived. She was struggling hard, obviously
terrified as to what DeSignieur would do to her, and was still being beaten. To try and
protect her, Mexal and Riccottannini broke ranks. Because of our ROE, both were
ordered back into ranks, but in the scuffle, Farquar pulled a sidearm from under his
jacket, positively identified as a projectile weapon by Mexal, Riccottannini, Fugazi,
Drake and DeLima, and threatened the woman with it. Farquar re-holstered his weapon
and DeSignieur and his forces withdrew, taking Sara with him.

DeLima went with Alpha squad to tail the group, and heard projectile weapons fire as
soon as the group was in the cover of the tree-line. They moved up quickly to find
Sara’s body against a tree, where she had been shot in the head, killed assumedly by
Farquar. Farquar was seen fleeing the scene, but was lost in the thick undergrowth. Two
slugs were retrieved from the tree as evidence. Unfortunately, none of the marines at
the scene could irrefutably identify which of the group had killed the woman.

At 1400 hours, myself and Marine Woe went outside the base to investigate a noise (the
base had been secured for lunch). As we emerged, we came under heavy fire from 3
hostiles and went down from IR. Marine reinforcements came out in support and
pushed the hostiles away from the base and took them down. Woe and | were
resuscitated and the hostiles bodies examined, but had no ID on themselves or their
weapons.

Bravo squad was sent out on patrol at 1520 hours to conduct Bio-Sampling requested
by Dr Freud. The normal Bravo compliment was supplemented by Mexal and the
Doctor, who would conduct the actual sampling. Samples were taken at grid refs
55363438, 55373432, 55233430 & 55203429.

The patrol was uneventful until the squad was moving up to the third sampling site. At
this point, 2 contacts were observed at grid 55175519. Site 3 was sampled, and Mexal,
Freud and Brent were sent to sample site 4 as quickly as possible as the rest of the
squad moved to challenge the contacts and provide cover. When we came within
approximately 25m of the contacts and were about to issue the challenge, the contacts
opened fire on us. We returned fire, but a further six hostiles appeared.

The sampling was complete, so | ordered a withdrawal by fire and movement back to
base. When we came within visual range of the base stag, wee signaled them and
Alpha moved up to support and move back into base. At no point had the hostiles
responded to a challenge or identified themselves, but after an extended fire-fight on the

base approach, one approached, offering a truce and surrender, and identifying
themselves as a civilian uprising unit, under “Viper”. A challenge and response of
“Transit” / “Navaho” was agreed and they withdrew.

shortly afterwards, a lone civilian was seen working in a clearing near the base (approx
grid 55403442). He was seen choking and having breathing trouble. | ordered Alpha’s
NBC trained marines to gear up and investigate. However, as Lothmore approached the
area, he too suffered breathing difficulties and fell unconscious. He was dragged well
clear of the area and recovered. However, another Marine started to suffer, even though
he was well clear of the first area and upwind of it.

A signal was sent to the G2 asking whether any portable breathing units were available,
and if any shipboard units could be adapted for base use. The base had apparently
once had an independent air supply (assumedly from when Sirius’ atmosphere was
unbreathable), but although all the piping was in place, all the support equipment had
been stripped out.

At 1649 hours, a sole civilian arrived, claiming he was a representative of “Viper” and
inviting the Captain to a meeting at 1730 hours. A maximum of three marines were
allowed and instructions for finding the rendezvous were given.

Immediately afterwards, four hostiles approached the base from the base 2 o’clock and
opened fire from the treeline. Bravo was on stag and challenged the hostiles as they
were NOT coming under effective fire. The hostiles did not respond, and we moved up
and pushed them away from the base using fire and movement as Alpha flanked left.
Two of the hostiles were quickly taken down and Bravo moved past them to consolidate
and take down the other two.

On investigation of the bodies, all were found to be dead. Two were confirmed NOT
downed by IR as their screens were still functional. Three of them were carrying
atmospheric monitoring cards, one of which indicated a colour change. A screen was
removed for examination by Sgt Martins, the ranking armourer on the scene.

At 1750, DeSignieur returned, reporting that his niece (the legitimate heir) was on-planet
and had been captured. He gave the location of a rendezvous with the kidnappers and
demanded that a full company strength assault be used to ensure her recovery at grid
55173429. The meeting was set at 1930 hours, conflicting with the “Viper” meeting.

When DeSignieur had left, G2 Ops were informed and advised that both operations
should be performed, with Captain Calvin meeting “Viper”. Intelligence gathered later
put the times for both operations back by one hour to 2030 hours.

Doctor Freud then gave a briefing on his findings on the atmospheric anomalies. He
said that the effect appeared to be caused by an “oxygen-repellant” molecule that is
also self-attractive, so aggregates into ever-growing clumps at ground level. These
clumps move in a manner analogous to mercury, and appear not to be affected by wind.
The area contains absolutely no oxygen, so normal respirators provide no protection.
The Doctor had also noted a faint HR signature to the molecule, and that it decayed
with time, but postulated that if the generation rate exceeded the decay rate, then the
entire planetary atmosphere might become non-supportive.

Abour 20 minutes before nightfall, a number of hostiles approached the base from the
base 3-o'clock and engaged the stag. Alpha and Bravo pushed them away and persued
in a two-way pincer movement, with DeLima joining the persuit. On the right flank,
however, Recruit Maz had a screen malfunction and | ordered Sgt Martins to see to it
and move up if possible. | was forced to hurry after Marine Woe, who was pushing the
attack but over-extending. This allowed a lone hostile to move in behind us and take me
down. | was successfully resuscitated, and rejoined the unit as they regrouped. We
returned to base and discovered that DeLima was missing. We believed that he had
been taken by the hostiles, who had been seen moving parallel to the base 12 o'clock
from the combat location. An oversize squad was staged and we moved to locate the
hostiles and determine if they had DeLima. If so we would rescue him.

We moved up on their axis of march and located the hostiles dug in at approx grid
55553439. The unit was split in to to pincer in on the hostiles, but we had not noticed a
forward unit, which engaged and stalled Sgt Beck’s team. My team came under heavy
fire and was forced to withdraw, ordering Sgt Beck’s team to bug out as well. During the
withdrawal, | was shot down by IR. At this point Marine Doe reports that Sgt Beck and
Marine Woe were pinned down in a ditch under heavy fire from the forward hostile
position. Marine Doe lay down covering fire, but they were unable to escape. When they
heard the hostiles calling out accurate fire-control on their positions, Marine Doe fell
back and Marine Woe escaped at a run from the ditch. Marine Doe repared his and
Marine Woe’s screens and withdrw to base for reinforcements where they
rendezvoused with Maz. Marine Doe led Marines Fugazi, Lothmore, Woe and Maz back
to the location and were able to recover Sgt Beck, myself and Lt DeLima.

Our CMO, Med-Sgt Dibbley was worried about the drugs situation, and requested more
supplies from the G2. Captain Calvin sent a signal to the G2, demanding close air-
support and CASEVAC capability for the rescue of DeSignieur's niece. Gillham was
authorised for close support & CASEVAC, with #3 on a high-CAP as cover.

At 2013, the civilian John who had been in the base when we arrived burst into the OPs
room and collapsed. He appeared to have been severely beaten, but with difficulty he
managed to say the words “Beware the Night-Hawks” before dying from his injuries.
Intelligence indicated that the “Night-Hawks” were DeSignieur's secret police force.

Captain Calvin left the base with Marines Fugazi and Lothmore for his rendezvous with
“Viper” whilst the rest of the unit prepared for the hostage rescue, to be commanded by
myself. The unit moved up to the rendezvous and waited past the expected time. There
were no contacts at all, and we suspected that Captain Calvin had been set-up. |
attached DeLima and Brent to Beck’s squad and ordered them to get to Calvin as
quickly as possible. | followed up with Dibbley and Mexal as a support and medical unit.

Bravo squad moved quickly up to grid 55443450 and observed a fire at grid 55383452.
Sgt Beck and Recruit Maz moved up to this point to investigate and attempt to make
contact with Viper. Meanwhile, the rest of Bravo moved to grid 55453452 in support and
were engaged by 4 hostiles who failed to halt when challenged. All 4 were taken down,
and the one Marine casualty, Sgt Martins was successfully resuscitated.

Beck and Maz, however, were captured by ex-CMC Colonel Nasco, who had been
masquerading as “Viper” and who threatened them with a projectile weapon. Captain
Calvin's patrol then appeared and rendezvoused with Bravo, and moved up to the fire to

~ meet “Viper” and locate Beck and Maz. This patrol was also captured, and bound and
left by the fire when Nasco left - taking Captain Calvin with him.

| then arrived with the Medical support unit having gone to ground for a while with a
suspected ambush on our line of march. When the company had re-grouped, | took
command and brought us back to base. A signal was sent to the G2 advising them of
Captain Calvin's capture, Nasco’s presence on planet and his possession of a projectile
weapon.

A debrief was held to make sure everyone knew the situation, and how dangerous
Nasco could be. Lt DeLima suggested and sent a signal to the G2 requesting a
relaxation of the ROE to allow first-fire on Nasco and the use of the Senty-Gun for base
defence, as well as requesting a meeting with DeSignieur and an interdiction of the
Sirius system to prevent Nasco’s possible escape.

The fire-first authorisation as agreed immediately, but the Sentry-Gun request was
deferred. DeSignieur, apparently, was giving G2 Ops and the UW the run-around. At
this point, a civilian female with a MS-CIV was escorted into the base. She claimed to
be the real “Viper”, and wondered why we had not met with her, and why the man she
sent to liase with us had not returned.

We interviewed “Viper”, and surmised that her liaison had been intercepted by Nasco
and that it was Nasco’s man that set us up for the ambush in which Captain Calvin had
been captured. She also informed us that a pipe-line ran from a Garp Corporation
facility, through an area adjacent to the operational area that was being mined by
DeWitt and to the atmosphere processor. Doctor Freud suggested that this might be the
cause of the atmospheric problems.

The last operation for the night, before securing the base, was to be a patrol to where
the pipeline crossed a stream and was believed to be fractured. Samples were to be
taken as evidence for the shutting down of the atmosphere processor and the
investigation of Garp Corporations activities.

Sgt Beck took a squad consisting of Recruit Maz, Tech-Sgt Mexal and Marine Lothmore,
guided by “Viper” to grid 55583438 to take the samples. Their route would skirt the
DeWitt territory, but “Viper” assured me that she could get the squad around the DeWitt
security patrols. The squad successfully reached the sample site and took the samples,
but were bounced on their return by a DeWitt combat patrol of approximately 10 men.
The combat was heard at base at approximately grid 55443437, and | took Bravo squad
out in support, flanking in from the right. We engaged the hostiles, but had unknowingly
approached them from abreast as they were trying to ex-fil. We took heavy casualties
from IR, and a prolonged fire-fight ensued as we attempted to locate all of Beck's
squad, and all of those who had gone out in support for medical treatment, all the while
coming under heavy sustained fire from the hostiles. Eventually, the hostiles withdrew
and we were able to retrieve and resuscitate all the Marines, although several were
close to the IR limit for resus-time. The search teams were unable to locate “Viper”.

We withdrew to base and secured it for the night as | sent a sit-rep to the G2 and

received notice that the UW ere attempting to get the atmosphere processor shut down
based on our evidence, and that our medical supply status was being evaluated.

### Mission: Day 2 - 17/03/96

The morning of Day 2 started quietly, with the stags reporting no contacts until 1040
hours. At this time, Farquar approached the base and effectively told me that Nasco
wanted to meet with me to “discuss” Captain Calvin’s situation. | was given a time and
coordinates as well as a weapon belonging to the captain as proof that they had him.

At 1100 hours, short fire-fight broke out at the base perimeter, when a hostile force of
unknown size tried probing our defences. The hostiles were fought off, with one of their
number KIA, and 4 Marines downed. All the Marines were successfully resuscitated,
and the hostile’s body searched for ID. As expected, no identifying marks were found -
Nasco had previously been heavily involved in Special Forces tactics and training
before his “resignation” from the CMC, and his forces were expected to use such tactics
and have access to weapons without serial numbers.

| took a small security force with me for the meeting with Nasco at 1130 hours. This
consisted of Sgt Beck and Recruit Maz as close in security with Marines Lothmore and
Fugazi as support. The meeting took place at grid 55523438. Farquar was running
security for Nasco, using one of Captain Calvin's weapons, and demanded that Fugazi
and Lothmore stay in position about 30m out where they had been spotted as they
moved into a flanking OP. Sgt Beck covered the rear as | walked forwards, with Maz as
my immediate cover man. | was obliged to remove my screen and weapon and kneel,
as was Maz, who | had tried to have brought forward as my security cover for détente,
although he kept his screen on and his weapon within arms reach.

Nasco was nastier than even | remember him - and so very full of himself for capturing
the Captain. He stated in no uncertain terms that the only course of action he would
leave open to the Marines would be for them to deliver Amy, the legitimate heir, into his
hands in exchange for Captain Calvin. The patrol returned to base.

Almost as soon as we had returned, DeSignieur was escorted in by a woman describing
herself as the Garp Corporation’s regional representative and one security guard.
DeSignieur looked resigned and cowed, completely the opposite attitude to that which
we were used to from him. The woman stated that Garp and DeWitt had just bought the
planet Sirius outright from DeSignieur, and were in full control. They ordered us to leave

planet immediately. Once they had left, a signal was sent outlining my meeting with
Nasco and the corporate visit. The reply was that the UW did not recognise the
corporations claims and stressed that we needed to find the late-Baron’s daughter and
ensure her safety as our first priority. A secondary tasking to rescue Captain Calvin and
capture Nasco was also set.

A formal signal confirming my orders was received, with an instruction that | should
contact Colonel Svjenson immediately on voice comms. He instructed me to insure
Amy's safety and dispatch off-planet at all cost, but also that his personal preference
would be that Nasco not be taken alive - a sentiment | knew would be mirrored by all
those Marines who remember Altair and Serentia.

Dibbley had signaled our low drug status to Surgeon-Commander

_ Mimiannapandawawa, and a drop capsule with additional supplies was launched -
aimed to land as near to the base as possible. As a patrol to recover the capsule was
staging, two civilians, a male and a female approached the base. They turned out to be
the late-Baron’s daughter Amy, with one of her retainers. They were interviewed, and
placed in accommodation in the most secure part of the base - the Doctor's offices with
a guard placed at the entrance to the area.

Alpha squad, led by Sgt Beck, went out and secured the capsule, and when they
returned at 1200 hours a recce patrol by Bravo squad, led by Sgt Martins, was
dispatched to reconnoiter along the boundary of DeWitt territory. At grid 55453437 they
found what appeared to be a Hanging-Jib on a tree, although it was not occupied.

| signaled the G2 that the first part of our tasking was complete - we had Amy - and
needed a dropship immediately to evacuate her off-planet. The dropship evac was
denied, however, since it had suspected corporate ships on her sensors and could no
launch a drop-ship during pre-combat maneuvers.

Alpha was resting up after returning from their patrol at 1225 when a oxygen deprivation
pocket drifted into the base building. Marine’s started to succumb, and the base was
hastily evacuated, with myself and Beck performing the final sweeps holding our breath.
Marine Woe had been resting by the fire, and had slid down out of sight and was hence
the last to be evacuated from the base - he had died from anoxia before he could be
moved into fresh air.

Sgt Beck acted as a canary, with myself holding breath to remove him from danger if the
pocket was still in the base - but it had moved on, and so the base was re-occupied and
Woe’s body put into cold-storage. “Viper” then re-appeared - apparently she had
managed to escape in the early stages of the previous night's fire-fight. She brought
intelligence that Garp and DeWitt were not conducting any corporate activities any more - they were fortifying the whole planet for use as a military base against the UW.

The response to this intelligence was a signal with new Rules Of Engagement - “Lethal
force may be used at CO’s or patrol commander's discression when exposed to any
threat or to achieve our tasking objectives”. We now had the authorisation to fire-first
against any possible threat.

A recce patrol was sent out at 1255 - Alpha squad's tasking being to recce the main
base approaches from both Garp and DeWitt territory. However, as they were leaving,
they came under fire from hostiles and with elements of Bravo pressed the attack home,
pushing the hostiles away from the base.

At this time, Farquar arrived again - with details of when and where the exchange were
to be made. He was jumpy, unhappy at the declaration by DeWitt and Garp, and worried
about Nasco’s aims - he obviously knew that Nasco was likely to execute him when he
stopped being useful. He was persuaded to make a deal - to sell out Nasco to us in
exchange for dropping the charge of murder against him and not immediately arresting
him. | did point out that getting off-planet past a UW blockade might be problematic for
him later, but he felt he would manage that himself. He gave me the time and route that
Nasco would be taking to the rendezvous and suggested that we should ambush him.

Alpha and Bravo were still mopping up the hostiles, but as soon as could be managed,
the unit was medic’d and armored up to full strength. We moved up to grid 55183429 to
set the ambush. The unit was organised as a large main fighting unit, with a two-man
flanking team of Fugazi and Lothmore with orders to flank around and come in behind
Nasco. Mexal and Dibbley formed a medic/armourer unit and were stationed 30m back
on the main path. MFC Riccottannini volunteered to impersonate Amy both to appease
Farquar and as a diversionary measure if needed. She remained with the medic unit.

Farquar showed us the track along which Nasco and his force would move up to the
rendezvous location, and suggested an L ambush with Sgt Martins and Marine Doe as
backstop and the rest of the unit along the path in a stand of bushes. He then
suggested and reluctantly | agreed that he should go and meet Nasco’s group first and
lead them into the ambush. He left his projectile weapon with Sgt Beck under my
authorisation as a show of faith, and moved off and | placed the main part of the unit in
a ditch in which a small stream ran, parrallel to the suggested ambush position, but less
exposed - and not where Farquar would expect us to be. Martins and Doe were left
where they were on the opposite side of the track and looking down it.

Nasco’s group arrived a couple of minutes later, patrolling into our ambush with some
care. One of his force started to patrol through the bushes where Farquar had
suggested we set up, and when Nasco, leading Calvin, was in the centre of the ambush
| ordered “open fire’. The Marines opened up, concentrating fire on Nasco’s security
forces, for at my call Captain Calvin had pulled a knife from his clothing and tried to stab
Nasco. Nasco turned and shot Calvin with a projectile weapon, fortunately hitting him
only in the leg, before running away from the line of Marines past the position of Sgt
Martins and Marine Doe who were concentrating fire on the man moving through the
bushes. All the hostiles on the path were put down, but with heavy Marine IR casualties - it appeared that only myself, Martins and Doe were still consious and fighting.

Martins and Doe had put down the man in the bushes and started to target fire on
Nasco as he ran past. Myself, Doe and DeLima executed a three-point pincer on Nasco,
trying to take him down from IR - Nasco turned and shot Martins - shattering his pelvis - and as his screen was shot down to its last hit he turned his projectile weapon on
himself rather than be taken by us. The weapon jammed and he went down.

Sgt Beck moved up to investigate and called that Nasco was unconsciuos but alive, with
his screen still on his head. | indicated that this was a shame, suggesting that we might
want to do something about that state of affairs - Nasco has caused the CMC, 5-Coy
and myself such personal injury that | would have had no problems with such action. Mr
DeLima pointed out that Nasco should be brought in alive for interrogation and moved
to guard him himself. | called Sgt Beck away to assist in the reorganisation and
resuscitation of the rest of the unit.

With all the hostiles now neutralised, | returned to the main unit as Fugazi and Lothmore
rejoined the company, and organised medical support. All the downed Marines were
successfully resuscitated, and Dibbley moved up to attend to Captain Calvin.

With the bulk of the unit medic’d up, | formed an ARD around the staging area
immediately adjacent to the nearest dropship landing site. Captain Calvin was
administered Diazamorphite and treated for severe CIM before being moved to the
staging point by myself and 5 other Marines.

| returned to where Sgt Martins had been treated, again with Diazamorphite and
suitable CIM measures - apparently he had attempted to get past DeLima to Nasco in
spite of his injuries - he too was a veteran of Altair and Serentia. Dibbley had moved to
Nasco and had mistakenly overdosed Nasco with fatal consequences.

Martins was evac‘d to the staging area, and Nasco’s body moved to the edge of the LZ,
well away from the units staging area. Gillham landed to CASEVAC Captain Calvin and
sgt Martins, but was caught in a low-level slide-wind and unfortunately landed on
Nasco’s body. The remains were recovered and bagged for DNA testing and the
casualties flown out.

The unit returned to base, secured it and were lifted off planet. A full debrief was held
back on the G2, to ensure that everyone was aware of the events that had taken place.
And it was during this debrief that MedBay informed me of the sad news that Sat
Martins had died of the wounds he had recieved from Nasco.

Unit Performance:

The overall performance of the unit was very good. Recruit Maz integrated flawlessly
with the experienced Marines and performed excellently - he will certainly go far in the
corps. There was some lack of command-and-control by unit leaders during the DeWitt
Combat Patrol incident on the night of the 16th, and in the base defence operation on
the following day. The latter incident left the base undermanned, and caused problems
in staging the ambush on Nasco as the unit could not be reformed until less than 10
minutes before the A-time, with hostiles still in the area. It should be noted that Mexal
will place her moral code above orders and ROE.

The OPs centre performed well, although additional Marines need to be OPs and
Comms-4 trained to assist in its operation.

### Conclusions:

The actions by DeWitt and Garp throughout the operation indicate a new aggressive
and anti-UW stamce from the two corporations. It is my belief that they were involved in
the death of the 10th Baron, working from the start to take the planet over. The fact that
Nasco was also intimately involved indicates the seriousness of their intent - Nasco was
possibly the most cruelly calculating murderer in history and their use of him and his
methods cannot bode well.

### Recomendations:

Following this operation, | would make the following recommendations.

That Mexal be given a formal verbal reprimand for her actions regarding DeSignieur's
treatment in the Base of the civilian female, Sara. Whatever her motives, she
dissobeyed ROE and a direct order to return to ranks, and contributed to making
Farquar draw a projectile weapon within the base.

That Recruit Maz be made Acting Marine effective immediately and full Marine upon
successfully passing his Basic- Training exam.

That the UW immediately interdict Sirius and begin sanctions and other punitive actions
as required against Garp and DeWitt and at the 10th Baron’s daughter's authorisation
begin actions to re-take the planet. These actions should be given top priority given the
intelligence on Garp & DeWitts plans for Sirius.

That Sgt Martins and Marine Woe’s names be added to the roll. | am aware of Captain
Calvins reservations regarding Martins, but he had served the Corps in combat
operations for almost five years and was in my opinion an excellent NCO, and as such,
his contribution and sacrifice should be recognised.

That at least 4 marines be trained in Tactical Operations and Comms-4 to assist in the
running of the OPs centre. This training could be informal and Skills-Grades(acting) be
issued until JSerTCom authorises and publishes appropriate training programmes for
those skills.
