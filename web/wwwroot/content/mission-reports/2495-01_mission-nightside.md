Report Filed by: Lieutenant Calvin. CA110328

### Mission Background:

Colonial Survey had been called to Grant’s World to investigate the loss of equipment
and personnel at the colonisation base “Grant’s Place”. CS investigators stated publicly
that colonist personnel were responsible for sabotage of equipment and subsequent
deaths and disappearances. On leaving the planet all contact was lost with the CSS
Lone Star’s shuttle returning the CS investigation team. Last transmissions were, “My
God what's that....look out...the light the light..”. No trace of wreckage was found on the
Lone Star’s radar or subsequent surface scans. Shuttle is reported to have disappeared
from scanner. The investigation team suspected, privately, that the situation may involve
other agencies other than the colonists.

### Mission Objectives:

Investigate cause of lost contact with shuttle of CSS Lone Star search for wreckage and
attempt to recover survivors and flight record.

Investigate cause of disturbance on Grant's World and if necessary or possible recover
and secure remaining colonists. Out of 10 Colonists 3 were reported dead with 2
missing, colony leader was a Mr R. Holtmann. Due to heavy handling by Colonial
survey an element of tact was recommended in dealing with remaining colonial staff.
The colonisation is a UW Funded project in preparation for Groombridge survivors, and
therefore a high priority.

### Planetary Conditions

Grant’s World is listed as Class M with no listed large life forms and lower than average
temperate climate. Some magnetic anomalies were reported on the planet's surface,
this appeared to interfere with unit's 49Mhz short range communications systems.

### Mission. 19/01/95

Insertion to planet was timed for 08:00, actual insertion occurred near 09:00, due to
delays incurred after a problem during the night with recruit Sparky Jnr (Jack). From the
LZ a march was taken direct to the base to “set-up shop’ for under the cover as a
combined search and rescue / patrol training mission. Whilst on planet Garavaglia
would make a full spectrum scan of the planet's surface and was not expected to be in
constant communication. Whilst moving towards the base camp, a sudden fog or mist
patch was encountered, no apparent effects were noted on personnel caught in this
mist, assumed to be a local atmospheric condition. One figure dressed in black and
apparently unarmed was encountered close to the base area during the march in. The
figure appeared to be wearing a mask or visor and made no attempt to communicate.
Despite a having pronounced limp the lead patrol was unable to stop the figure to offer
assistance, a slow “Non-aggressive’ approach was made. As squad leader | did not
believe that sending several armed marines piling after what may have been an injured
colonist to be a particularly friendly or passive act. The figure was able to break contact
and evade the lead squad in undergrowth near the base no tracks or trace was found.
The base swept to ensure that it was clear, a message of welcome had been pinned on
the door from colonists. Guard patterns and roving patrols established, prior to
commencing breakfast.

The Colonists returned to base and were interviewed by Maj. Harris, as to the nature of
the disturbances and conduct of the Colonial Survey investigation team. | did not gain
information from this interview, other than a general impression that the colonists
resented our presence as interference. Major Harris has full details of this interview.
During the interview, two explosions sounded outside, | took a squad to deal with the
situation. Only one hostile was sighted, although reports from other squad members
suggest there may have been a second figure. This seemed to be a probing attack, the
figure was dressed in black using a heavy weapon, possibly a pulse ranger, staying out
of effective range, despite attempts to outflank him contact was lost close to the colony
uplink mast. Colonists seemed unwilling to believe that other people may be on planet.

| took a squad out with colonist “Joe” (Full names with Maj. R. Harris) to search along
projected path of CS Shuttle, for signs of a forced landing or wreckage. Four figures
were observed in discussion 50-100m from line of march, they were wearing military
screens but did not appear to be armed. We did not approach having been charged with
the safety of “Joe”. Both Sgt Chaos & Marine Welesley believed that at least one figure
seemed similar in appearance to one of the colonists, though | was not able to
confirmed this information at the time. An extended line search was made over what
Joe felt was one of the most likely impact points.

No wreckage was found in the area or signs of disturbance to the ground and
surrounding foliage. Rings of a white powdery substance were located, Joe, associated
these rings with sabotage events and fog, stating that were usually found after an
incident, and were often washed or blown away by the weather.

A sample of the powder was taken and returned to base. Subsequent analysis showed
the material composition to be mix of Metal, Plastic and Animal Tissue residue having
suffered severe molecular disruption, the sample also possessed an abnormally high
level of magnetic properties.

During the morning / early afternoon further probing fire continued on base although
contacts were observed. These finally lead to full assault by 10+ hostiles, pushed off by
a counter attack. Two black figures seen in fight attacking both sides, the main attack
force were unwilling to engage these figures and would flee rather than fight them.
During the combat it was noted that the appearance and loss of contact with the
“Blacks’ was preceded by a whistling sound and an explosion, similar to an artillery
shell, no physical trace of these figures was found despite having been observed going
to obvious cover. Sgt Smith and | had both flanks on one going to ground in a group of
bushes, no trace was found of the figure in the vicinity.

One “Main Force’ hostile was captured, he claimed to be a Hengist, trying to perpetrate
an Aliens Hoax to prepare the planet for full contact. He expressed concern about the
disappearances and claimed to have similar losses among his comrades. Shortly after
this point | found it necessary to retire to my bunk to recover “Time Lag” between Grants
World and Barnard.

sgt Chaos briefed me when |! came back on duty that the two Black figures were
reported to be Androids a PCB had been found having been observed being removed
and replaced from one by the other. 2 patrols had gone out - 1 Patrol discovered frozen
body, the 2nd patrol was bounced from which Welesley & Riccotonini were still missing.
During this period, Major Harris had collated evidence against a Mr Ryan, one of the
colonists as a participant or aid in the sabotage of equipment.

After his arrest Ryan admitted membership of the Hengist organisation and assisting in
the sabotage against the colony. At this point it became necessary to restrain the other
colonists from attacking Mr Ryan. Marine Quark was reprimanded for apparently
threatening to shoot Ryan during his arrest. Mr Ryan was detained both to prevent his
further ability to disrupt the colony and his own protection.

shortly after former JVC executive, Mr Farquhar , was allowed in base by the guard, on
recognising him | asked him turn over his side arm, which he was unwilling to surrender
to the guard. Mr Farghar stated the Hengists either had or were a problem, and claimed
that a least one group was working for him and also referred to “The Soldier’ (one of the
androids) as a personal contact.

Referring to the loss of the CS shuttle, Mr Farquhar offered to “allow “ V Coy off planet
with no further interference. He claimed to be helping Hengists clear the planet, with the
assistance of or in conjunction with the Androids , Jester and Soldier. We declined Mr
Farquhar offer and having no legal grounds to hold him allowed him off base, Mr
Farquhar was followed in the direction of the colony uplink mast, about half way
between the base and this land mark he was caught in what appeared to be an
explosion, no trace other than a white dust was found, a sample was taken to genetic
finger printing with Mr Farquhar's records.

Mr Ryan eventually stated there were two Hengist groups on planet, an original
sabotage crew and new “Hard Line’ group or strike team. He persisted in his clam that
he did not claim to know about the deaths and disappearances, attributed to early
arrival of the aliens.

Mr Ryan was released and tailed to Comms Mast by MFC Rouge and MFC Zeus,
where he met up with his buddies. A raid put together to neutralise this group, the whole
company took part in the raid, 2 Hengists using civilian screens were killed, one was
captured, another ran off.

The prisoner was debriefed by Major Harris, the information gleaned on presence and
position of Hard liners allowed a second full assault to be put together. Taking point with
MFC Rouge a route out was taken bringing the company as close as possible to a
wooded area identified as the base area for the Hengist strike team. A sweep of the
wooded area showed no enemy contact, one Hengist was sighted on a high level area
at the top end of the woods, but avoided contact, this may have been the Hengist
released by Major Harris.

Capt. Zwalf took patrol a patrol down through the woods, apparently his squad was
subsequently taken down in 30 seconds flat by hostiles with Heavy weapons. My squad
was ordered to patrol down the open tree line, four to five hostiles were encountered
and held off, the squad was pulled back by Maj. Harris told to hold our position at the
top of the woods. Maj. Harris went with Alpha squad into the woods to contact Capt.
Zwalf. In our defensive position | ordered screens repaired. Some shouting & fire was
heard , | broke cover and went to investigate, being unable to raise Major Harris or
Capt. Zwalf on the radio.

We came across a unit troops in woods and challenged, they identified as CMC, the unit
appeared to be downed members of Major Harris & Capt. Zwalf’s squad, Marine Ratch
was removed from my squad to assist medic. We encountered some sniping, by
hostiles but this was pushed off. My Squad lead the company back to base, Sgt Martins
found down outside the base with all power off MFC Rouge, Marine Breck and | cleared
the base and identified a large bomb | immediately ordered the base cleared.

The live bomb was removed by Marines Cardinal and Breck whom | would recommend
for a commendation for their actions in this regard.

Whist holding position | was approached by what eventually turned out to be Marine
Quark and his buddy as | was unaware that we had a patrol in his area | challenged, the
response was neither correct nor complimentary ("F*** off you Tit" as I recall !) - I opened
fire. Quark was later reprimanded for insulting behaviour.

The still live bomb was removed away from base and control detonated. During this
operation we were attacked and managed to push hostiles off with a counter attack,
during which a number (at least 3 were killed). During the raid the base was approached
by what appeared to be one of the missing colonists. The man in question appeared to
be very confused by his experiences and was unable to give coherent answers to any
questions, including his identity. From what | was able to gather, the man stepped inside
a circle on the ground, close to where Mr Farquar went missing. A pinkish flash or light
surrounded him and he then came face to face with people “with starry eyes’. He had
escaped from these people and found himself in a raised area near to the colony
Comms Mast, from which the morning's assault was launched.

The Company was moved to this area and met an armed force of six to eight persons
on a rise, possibly a water tank. This force was neutralised by a full scale attack, one
prisoner was taken and questioned by Major Harris. Apparently this prisoner indicated
the presence of a second group in a gully some 50-100 behind the base expecting an
evac. After a fast march to the indicated position the armed personnel found were taken
out in a brief firefight. As with the first force these appeared to be Hengists close to a
circle on the ground with Marine Welesley inside, Capt. Zwalf crossed the circle to
recover Welesley at which point there was a whistle and bang, normally associated with
the appearance / disappearance of the androids. Both Capt. Zwalf and Marine Welesley
disappeared and are hence posted Missing in Action. Marine Ricottonini was recovered
alive.

A patrol of the area showed no further signs of Hengist activity, Major Harris declared
the area as secure and withdrew the marine force on planet.

### Conclusions.

The Hengist movement, long thought to be a fringe organisation, has clearly changed
it's tactics to a highly aggressive terrorist method. Whether this is a general trend or the
actions of a radical minority requires further investigation, particularly with regard to
support and training, which seems to be external.

The loss of Capt. Zwalf and Marine Welesley is perplexing as it is disturbing. On the
evidence available it would appear that a form of teleportation is being used or
simulated to effect the removal of property and personnel. The reappearance of the
missing colonist may shed additional light on the matter, if he is able to provide reliable
and coherent information after a full psychological analysis. My own personal opinion is
that if he was telling the truth we may yet see Capt. Zwalf and Marine Welesley again
and possibly Mr Farghar.

This opinion is based on a report | filed November 2494 concerning the possible illegal
sale of “Teleportation’ equipment on Earth. The potential of this equipment seems to
have been put to full tactical use on Grant’s World the consequences of this being used
wide scale by unscrupulous individuals may be serious. However | would advise
caution, as with the Boeing- McDonnell Douglas JSE hoax of 2183, this may be a stunt
to prove the use of teleportation equipment to raise the price for a sale of non-functional
equipment.

With regard to the presence of the androids, Soldier and Jester it is unclear what their
motives or mission may have been other than testing or protecting the equipment being
used. Jester was reported on the “Shambles” planet as far as | am aware it has not
shown hostile intent before.

The general performance of five company was hampered by a lack of communications
both radio and personal. This is probably attributable to a long period of downtime
following the quarantine after X244. Major Harris and | were forced to discuss a problem
on the interpretation of orders from the night mission which emphasised this point. |
believe this assisted in gelling the company for the final assaults on the Hengist
positions

Following their successful completion of Med Grade 2, | would recommend Marine
Ratch and MFC Dibbly be considered for promotion to Corporal, even if this should be a
medical rather than field grade promotion.
