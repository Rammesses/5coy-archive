**Mission Ogre** was a covert operation organised by the UW Rep on Hal and a local
senator on planet. 5 Coy’s presence bn planet was as a result of a request by the UW
Rep. Actual details are presently unclear most notes were destroyed prior to the
company’s surrender to local forces, my own recollection is compromised by the loss of
these notes, the time detained on a planet and the possible after effects of an APD on
the morning of 10/4/94.

##### Planetary Conditions

Hal proved to be average in terms of gravity and air quality. Local weather conditions
were prone to rapid and extreme change from clear sky to heavy snow / hail which
tended to make most forms of clothing inappropriate (Too hot / not hot enough). Night
temperatures tended to be very cold.

Mission orders were received by standard, CMC Commnet. No issuing officer name
appeared on this document. Subsequent inspection has shown that the Commnet I.D
and document reference are also missing. Since the data interchange should not accept
message envelopes without a message reference and cross matches for Sender,
Recipient, Message type, Message version and Standards authority, Mail box access
code, Mail system clearing code and internet password, it may be possible that the
CMC / UW Commnet security has been compromised.

Transit to planet was via civilian vessel to a reserve training base used by Hal reserve
forces. This base was not in frequent use and had to be cleared of stored equipment to
be made usable. Mission orders stated that a local official would identify himself known
and provide us with assistance and support. Our orders also stated that this person had
full authority to issue the company orders while on planet. | am unable to recall the
name of this person and shall hereafter refer to this man as the Senator. The Senator
provided us with a cover story as a reserve training unit of the 3rd Cohort of the 9th
Legion. Hal’s military forces use naval terms to denote rank, as | remember them these
are:

- Marine = Seaman
- MFC = Able Seaman
- Col = Bosun
- Sat = Chief / CPO
- Lt = Ensign
- Cot = Lieutenant
- Major = Captain

Only the first two Cohorts of a Legion tend to be regulars the remainder are reservists.
There are special forces, presumably these are drawn from serving regular Cohorts as
normal.

The mission as described by the Senator was to neutralise a rebellion force threatening
to disrupt / overthrow the government. In return for our cooperation the Senator had
agreed with the local UW rep to push for closer ties with the UW over and above all a
recognition of the Projectile Weapons Ban. Our involvement was to be kept secret to
prevent anti UW factions in the government supporting the Rebels. The Senator stated
that the reason for summoning the assistance the CMC instead of using local armed
forces was due to severe security problems and sympathisers within Hal regular forces.
The Senator made several visits with two body guards wearing what appeared to be
body armour. Our first contacts were with Hal militia, who seemed to mistake us for
rebels one was captured and, in the interest of reducing casualties turned over to the
senator for safe keeping, the Senator ordered his guards to execute the man.

The first contact with the Rebel forces yielded one prisoner who repeatedly claimed that
the Senator was a traitor and not to be trusted. There was a certain amount of
reservation in handing this woman over to the Senator, given his treatment of the Hal
Militia man. The Senator executed the prisoner for treason, without trail, Major Harris
reminded us that our orders were to cooperate with the Senator. Major Harris, Officer
Cadet Oslo and myself were witnesses to the summary execution of the prisoner on the
direct orders of the Senator.

At around the same time, prior to the senator's visit | had been part of a patrol which
had contacted and escorted a group of four civilians to base, who claimed to be former
workers for the Senator, at their behest they were kept away from the Senator during his
visit.

The group were scared of any and all armed personnel although they seemed ignorant
or the effects of |.R. weapons. They all appeared to be uneducated brought up in
conditions of serfdom or slavery as once existed on ancient Earth. AS we were
uncertain of the Senator's reaction the group were allowed to leave after his departure.

The Senator and his guards later returned with one of the group and executed them in
front of the barracks area as “a warning’ he also claimed to have found the other three
although this was not confirmed by any patrols in the area of operation. |

During the afternoon a squad of regular Hal troops turned up with a civilian, who had
apparently lead them to the base claiming that she was able to recognise us, she was
later identified to me as Ms Krysal Spyers of the Interstellar Communications Group. Ms
opyers was able to identify Maj Harris among other members of the company, in the
ensuing firefight Ms Spyers lost her screen whilst running towards cover, one Hal
regular was able to escape the field and evade search. It was at approximately this
point that the decision was taken to withhold medical assistance from downed enemy
personnel we did not have the facilities to hold prisoners and the Senator seemed keen
to maintain security by shooting any prisoners taken or revived.

Shortly after Ms Spyers arrival the local UW rep arrived on base. She was able to report
that she had called in Marine assistance to help the Senator crush the rebellion. The
aim apparently was to credit the Senator for stopping the rebellion thus allowing him to
be elected to high / presidential office in return he would use his influence to sway the
senate to join the UW. After some questioning it became apparent that the Senator did
not have the full backing of his government and doubts were expressed over the UW
reps integrity in the situation. On being presented to Ms Spyers the rep ordered her
execution, Major Harris stated that he was only prepared to carry out such an order in
response to a signed written order. Writing materials were provided, the rep signed an
order for the execution of Ms Spyers, no charges were specified, the order was shown
to Mr Oslo and myself by Major Harris for confirmation. Ms Spyers was taken outside by
Maj Harris and returned to the barracks unconscious or dead, she was pronounced
dead by Sgt O’Shaunessy.

The Senator was able to provide information on the position of the local Hal military
commnet relay station and stated that the rebel leadership were to meet soon, the
location of this meeting would come via a mole within the rebel forces. Two missions
were mounted, first to find and neutralise the rebel unit in which the Senator's informant
operated the second to knock out the communications relay station.

The first mission found only the body of a rebel with a radio close to the position given
for the location of the mole’s unit. The patrol was ambushed returning to base by rebel
forces, the attack was neutralised and the Senator's mole wasrecovered. He seemed
unwilling to divulge any information to us it, was assumed that this was under the direct
order of the Senator. The Senator recognised the man as his informant and asked to be
allowed to debrief the man in private while his guards stood watch. The interrogation
given by the Senator involved torture, several marines attempted to get past the guards
to intervene, a scuffle broke out which stopped when Major Harris ordered those
involved to back off and sit down. The Senator later emerged covered in blood and
indicated the position and time of meeting, his informant had suffered several wounds
with a bladed weapon at the hands of the Senator who later terminated his life.

At least one attempt was made by Hal regular forced to verify our identity, a special
forces unit arrived on base asking for assistance and wanting to know who we were, |
dealt with a Chief in their unit and gave him the cover story provided he requested
confirmation and then ordered his unit to open fire.

A night raid was mounted to knock out the Hal comms relay station in the hope of either
preventing news of our presence spreading or stopping orders from Hal central
command reaching local units. The mission was run at reduced manpower due to field
losses through combat and several marines going sick due to the adverse conditions.
Two marines, Cardinal & Reld, suffered leg injuries due the terrain and visibility causing
the assault to be called off, during the recovery operation the unit was hit by a heavy
hail storm, adding further testimony to the changeable nature of Hal’s weather.

##### Sunday

Two Squads were able to move onto the position occupied by the communications relay
and knock it out. The area was well defended by a squad of Hal militia dug in on a hill
with good all round visibility.

The second assault was carried out on the rebel meeting area, the attack plan was to
move parallel to a road and move in line abreast in two supporting lines. | am informed
that this operation went as planned, during the assault | came upon and called a trip
wire, the APD to which it was attached was triggered by a marine passing some 5-10m
to my left | have no clear recollection of events until returning to base.

After midday a battalion of Hal regulars surrounded the base, they took command of the
senators personal body guard and gave him 24 hours to leave planet. They addressed
us aS CMC 5 Coy and asked us to surrender, despite some misgivings, having
observed the Senator's treatment of prisoners it was agreed that in the interest of
preserving life that we would in fact surrender to what was clearly a larger force. A
number of documents and notes were destroyed and all weapons were disabled. After
an indeterminate time in Hal detention the company was shipped off planet.

### Conclusions

With regard to actual mission objectives 5 Coy were successful in carrying out it’s
orders in neutralising the resistance movement on Hal. The fact that Ms Spyers was
aware of our presence on planet and the unauthodox nature of the mission recall orders
suggests that there is a security problem within the CMC Commnet structure or
systems. This coupled with our failure to capture the escaping member of the Hal
regular unit lead to the ultimate discovery of 5 Coy’s presence on planet jeopardised the
mission and will have serious repercussions on future UW relations with Hal.

The actual resistance movement on Hal appears to have had wide spread support
among it’s citizenry and armed forces alike. The apparent reluctance of Hal military to
put the resistance down is understandable if the Senator's behaviour is typical of the
planet’s ruling classes.

Major Harris’ behaviour was, given the circumstances, very good, he managed to
maintain discipline and order when the actions we were been ordered to take were
clearly against the nature of Maj Harris and all other marines on planet. Mr Oslo, the
senior NCO’s and myself were able to draw on this example in maintaining discipline
and morale. The company was ordered to note and report all orders given and actions
taken on planet by the UW Rep and the Senator.

The order to with hold medical assistance from downed enemy personnel was made on
humanitarian grounds despite wishing to minimise casualties to Hal regular forces. We
did not have the facilities or manpower to hold prisoners and we could not allow them to
report back to their units, since the Senator's treatment of prisoners was to shoot them
Maj Harris decided that was best to let them pass on as a result of the initial combat |.R
damage, | fully support this decision. The Senator and the UW Rep have, presumably
left Hal, if they are in UW custody then an investigation should be started as to what
charges if any can be brought against the Senator. Although most of his actions
occurred off base at least one murder was committed by the Senator on base, although
the legal position of the status of the base as UW territory will be in doubt as our
presence on planet may ultimately prove to have been illegal.

The UW Rep may have breached a number of UW & CMC regulations in summoning 5
Coy on planet and issuing orders to 5 Coy there may also be some doubt as to her
diplomatic status. What is clear is that the Rep ordered the execution of a UW citizen,
Ms K Spyers, without charge or trial which constitutes a breach of Ms Spyers rights
under UW law. Ms Spyers may also have a number of things to answer for, how did she
obtain knowledge of a covert operation and how did she manage to arrange passage to
Hal and set down outside of Hal's controlled civilian airspace.

Cyber Knight was able to pack himself away and managed to leave base shortly after
the Senator's execution of the rebel prisoner, his whereabouts are currently unknown.
Given Cyber Knight's frequent presence on missions and often sudden departures it
may be prudent to review his status with regard to participation in future operations.

During the operation Mr Oslo raised a point regarding orders which | would support,
which is that of legality. What is the legal position of troops who carry out the orders of
superior knowing that the order is illegal, or whose implementation would constitute an
illegal act ?. Case in point is the various war crimes trials that have followed many of the
major conflicts on Earth as well as on other UW planets since the mid 20th Century,
including the Nazi War Trials, the Balkans war trials and the Cannibalism trials after the
food wars. Guide lines regarding the legal status of orders and reporting illegal orders
need to be clarified to prevent the events on Hal from being repeated.
