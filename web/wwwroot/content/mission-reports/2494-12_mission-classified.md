### Mission Objective:

The mission was a live firing search and rescue training exercise, conducted in
conjunction with unnamed elements of CMC Special Forces. V Coy would form part of a
search and rescue mission to recover a downed ship in hostile territory. SF would form
an opposing enemy irregular unit specific goals were:

- Recovery / Destruction of Ship Flight Recorder.
- Recover Drop ship personnel
- Minimise Contact with local forces / population
- Sanitise locale of drop ship crash

Drop Ship Crew listed as 8:

- 2 Crew
- 6 Special Forces

##### Command Staff:

- Calvin, A, 2 Lt

##### CMO:

- O’Shaunessy, C, Sgt (Acting)

##### Casualties:

- NONE

##### Hostile Forces

- Special Forces Units

##### Neutral / Friendly Units

- Exercise Referee “Contacts”

### Planetary Conditions

In accordance with Special Forces wishes, the training location was kept secret. The
theatre of operation was prone to high ievels of cioud Cover and precipitation. The drop
zones and area of search were under a dense fog bank at the time of drop making an
immediate search both hazardous and unprofitable.

The high levels of rain and fog caused repeated problems with electronic systems,
including screens and weapon systems. These conditions also contributed to several
possible cases of hypothermia which effected the combat fitness of several marines on
the exercise

### Exercise 1: Locate Contact & Base of Operations (02/12/2494)

Due to the conditions of the operation a pre-rendezvous point was selected close to the
meeting point with our contact. Despite the conditions, all three drop ship pilots were
able to provide reasonably accurate co-ordinates for their actual landing zones,
facilitating navigation.

My squad picked up Sgt Martins’ squad en-route to our RV, a defensive position was
taken up until Sgt Apone’s squad appeared. Sgt Apone had been experiencing screen
problems, which had slowed his progress. Overall , conditions of poor visibility (less
than 5m) contributed to maintaining cover up to the contact point.

At the contact point we encountered a Special Forces four man patrol, who had been
able to capture our contact prior to our arrival, using the fog to conceal our numbers we
able to overpower this unit and release our contact.

Our contact provided us with the location of our base, which we were then able to
locate. No contacts were made en- route to the base. Entry was by two man cover
formation to check the base for APD’s . The base was cleared, entered and secured.

### Exercise 2: Reinforcement Pickup & Stage One Line sweep (03/12/2494)

The Contact provided data that a reinforcing shuttle was expected and also provided
information on the plotted trajectory and crash markers for the downed ship. As the LZ
for this vessel was close to one end of the line of trajectory, it influenced a search down
the line of the valley along the side of a lake. The line of trajectory of the ship followed
the southern shoreline of a lake down towards a smaller outlet and valley as indicated
on the enclosed map.

The search for wreckage would constituted a line abreast search through the woods
down to the south east outlet of the lake and into the river valley beyond as indicated.

As the resupply LZ was close to the search starting point | saw no point in splitting the
force to pick this group up. Acting Sgt Chaos was placed in command of this new squad
when it was picked up and identified. A major concern at this point was the possibility of
an SF ambush or infiltration team.

The first phase of the search exercise brought us into contact with two “civilians,” who
complained of the high level of military activity on their land. Since this pair did not
appear to be screened they were informed that the area was involved in a live fire
exercise and escorted out of the area.

First contact with SF was with two men from a four man patrol who had become
separated after attempting to maintain the scenario cover story, they began to questions
us outside of our “Scenario Cover’ story | decided that our position may be
compromised and neutralised this unit. The remainder of this unit tried to engage but
were also taken down. Referees in cover were able to render medical assistance as we
started to move on.

Continuing our sweep we encountered two more “civilians” who had several conflicting
stories, after a brief exchange | ordered them to leave the area on the pretext of the
hazard posed by the exercise, | am fairly certain that this was an SF infiltration team.
The decision not to take out was based on using the |.D from the earlier SF patrol to
misinform these contacts. This phase of the search was terminated at the road crossing
the lake at its southern end.

On return to base an armed “civilian” group were intercepted by Sgt Chaos in base and
taken down, from their behaviour and equipment an immediate search for APD’s was
conducted. The civilians had in their possession the drop ship flight recorder ejection
capsule, a flight recorder decoder and a case from the drop ship that they had forced,
containing CMC / UW identification papers and documents.

The prisoners were interrogated separately information gleaned from them was:

- The dropship had crashed in deep water
- There were no survivors
- The flight recorder had been found on land

We were unable to establish the identity of either prisoner, in light of this | opted to
continue the search, whilst securing the prisoners, SF managed to gain entry to the
base, first knocking out the screen generator. As most screens were in repair being
dried this attack was successful, SF did not manage to penetrate the barracks where
one prisoner was held. Sgt Turner organised a counter attack from this position which
cleared the base.

The final section of the sweep was conducted in the river valley, a temporary shelter
was encountered on the hill side, this appeared to have been in position for some time
and did not contain any materials identifying its origin however it was taken as possible
evidence of survivors, the shelter was left in place. During the initial sweep SF had set-
up an ambush either side of a track on the southerly side of the valley during this
combat Sgt Turner was injured by an APD and needed to be moved out of the combat
zone.

Two SF troops were able to capture Marine’s Zeus and Cassell, Sgt Apone reports that
he was unable to stop or engage this pair due to a screen failure.

Marine Axe attempted to negotiate with SF while a brick circled behind them although
this unit was spotted it was able to close the back door on the SF escape route. Cassell
and Zeus were recovered to the extraction point after a brief fire fight in which both
assailants were “killed”. As before scenario referees were able to attend to the downed
troops. Zeus and Cassell were designated unconscious casualties.

The unit was then split down to a search unit and medical unit to move the injured back
to the extraction point. Both sides of the valley were swept for survivors / wreckage with
no result. With the time approaching 16:00 Hrs | was forced to abandon the search for
survivors. On return to the EP we encountered a four man team with a prisoner, who we
took to be a survivor. We attempted to pass ourselves off as SF which got us in close
enough to neutralise this force without further loss.

### Conclusions

On the whole this was a tough exercise but served to get the company back on form for
active duty. As expected SF made the most of any mistakes made by the company
however these were recovered as much as possible without going out of time.

Electronics were a serious problem, one of the main features of this exercise was
having enough reliable screens available to risk combat, drop out exceeded 20% on
several occasions, compounded with weapons misfires due to water intrusion, proofing
needs to improve, if at all possible.

Important information may have been missed on this exercise due to poor interrogation
technique coupled with SF's training to resist interrogation. This could have damaged
operations. | would recommend V Coy for training in the correct use of interrogation
techniques. Information gained from contacts and prisoners can effect the outcome of a
live operation, the exercise showed that V Coy’s training in this area is lacking.

### Training Recommendations:

##### Interrogation

- Sgt Martins
- Sgt O’Shaunessey
- Sgt Chaos
- Cpl Axe
