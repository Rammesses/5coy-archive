### Mission: Day 1 - 11/03/94

Nyytoda Base setup operations proceeded until approximately 21:00 when Marines and
recruits were equipped and fed. First patrols were mounted at approximately 22:00 to
check the security and layout of the immediate area of the base. The base is a two story
permanent structure with a permanent ground vehicle access route running parallel to
the front and a dirt track intersecting this at the main gate. Parallel to the track there is a
permanent stone wall approximately 2m high. To the rear there is a shuttle landing bay
approximately 50m wide by 10m deep parallel to the rear of the base. The main
entrance to the base is located at the rear opening onto the shuttle landing area there
are 2 more emergency exits on the ground floor and on the first floor from the side of
the front barracks area. The remainder of the base area and environs are as detailed on
CMC maps of the region.

Hostile activity consisted of one unidentified sniper taking up position within the tree line
120m to the rear of the base. The sniper was taken down in action involving a flanking
move. Two marines went down due to I|.R during this action, myself included. Further
deep patrols were mounted to confirm local terrain and security prior to base lock down
at 23:30.

### Mission: Day 2 -12/03/94

Kit inspection was taken by myself it was pleasing to note that the SPICE recruitment
programme appeared to be working well, the recruits barracks area proved to be much
neater than that of the regular marines. This is due in part to having less kit but is more
likely to be due to barracks training still being fresh in their minds.

The regular marines were provided with a tour of the recruit’s barracks as a refresher
course.

Preparations for the recruit’s training exercise involved setting up a security perimeter
around the base and training area to allow the recruits and aggressor force to operate
their weapons in training mode. A wooded area to the front of the base was selected
bordered by an open field. | took the aggressor force on a security sweep through the
training area prior to set up. At this time a male civilian had been sighted walking around
the base perimeter, he appeared reluctant to communicate with patrols, preferring to
keep a distance. |

Regrettably the training exercise allowed one recruit to get through from the first group
by “Playing Possum” while this was possibly a good display of initiative on the part of
the recruit it indicates a lack of procedure on the part of the training group which could
cause casualties in the field. Orders were given to verify “Kills” when the second group
came through. On returning from the training exercise a second civilian was
encountered in the recruit marshalling area, this turned out to be a Mr Amos Grant who
claimed to be a member of the clan to which the land on which base is built belongs.
The first civilian we had seen turned out to be a kinsman Bart Grant. The Grants were
interested in talking to Major Haris, both were willing to surrender their screens and
sidearms upon entering the base.

The Grant's general manner appeared to be both open and confident. Most of the
talking was done by Amos Grant. The purpose of his visit seemed to be to reopen a
deal that, according to Mr Grant, had been struck between the Grant clan and Major
Flank. The nature of this deal was that the Grants, the largest local clan, would stop
attacking the base and Marine patrols if Major Flank concentrated his attention on two
neighbouring families, the Douglas’ and the Ploughers. There had apparently been a
number of side deals which were described as mutually beneficial. Mr Grant expressed
an interest in a number of consumable commodities that were not locally available,
notably coffee. Mr Grant had talked to Major Haris and Sgt Apone about hostages being
taken, | was not party to this conversation and am unable to quote it accurately. Shortly
after Mr Grant’s departure the base came under attack from an unknown force. There
tactics involved presenting 2-4 assailants to draw out a strike force which would then
come under assault from a crossfire ambush from up to 3 other hostiles with heavy
weapons. During the course of the morning the base came under several attacks
including an exchange of mortar fire between two factions which landed close to the
base, there were no casualties.

Mr Grant returned prior to lunch to see if we had decided whether we were prepared to
do the same deal as he had arranged with Major Flack, Bart Grant accompanied him
this time wearing a military issue screen, as before both surrendered their equipment
enabling me to run a check on Bart Grant's equipment. Weapon and screen both
checked as CMC issue listed as missing or destroyed by Major Flank. Bart Grant
indicated that he had been given the items by an Uncle Frank. Amos Grant seemed
keen to do business, first offering livestock for a Female Marine and pushing for his
“Understanding” with the Corps commander to be confirmed. | was able to spend some
time with Mr Grant in order to discuss local conditions the information that follows is
entirely from Mr Grant.

Mr Grant is uncertain of the date that his family colonised the planet only that they have
been on planet for three generations. The economy is predominantly agricultural though
not suited to a wide variety of produce, Tea grows but coffee will not.

The main source of income is cattle / livestock and this is difficult to bring up. The
Douglas and Plougher families arrived three and nine years later respectively and this
seems to have been a source of immediate conflict. The Grants were unwilling to share
or cooperate when “There's barely enough food to feed you're own family” this view has
apparently been adopted by the other families as well. Each clan grows until it is strong
enough to expand then it spreads out, if it goes through a bad patch it pulls back to it’s
centre of power to regroup. Buildings and livestock are prized by all parties and damage
to both is avoided during times of expansion / recession. When questioned about cattle
stealing he replied that the only incidence had been perpetrated by a stranger who had
been pulled apart by 3 tractors, one from each clan.

Mr Grant expressed dissatisfaction in the deal struck to give up projectile weapons
some 2 years ago. These were exchanged for agricultural machinery, however a lack of
local mineral fuels and high tech parts has lead to most of these machines falling into
dissuse. Some are kept going by methanol stills but the resources still do not exist to
maintain them.

Mr Grant claimed that his clan was the largest partially by virtue of the deal struck with
Major Flank. At this point Mr Grant was keen to reiterate the level of disruption that his
clan could create to the operation. Mr Grant expressed concerns that the other clans
would join up to eliminate the Grants should they discover their dealings with the Marine
Corps.

As before hostilities picked up after Mr Grant’s departure after lunch. It was during this
period that deputations from the Douglas and Plougher clans arrived to level complaints
of collaboration with the Grants against the Marine core. Both sides had to physically
restrained from brawling in the mess area and were ejected for the base under escort
when it became apparent that neither side was willing to discuss the situation with the
other present. Both parties had expressed concerns that hostages taken from their
families had not been returned, where Grant hostages had. Both sides seemed
unprepared to believe Major Haris when he explained that we did not know of their
whereabouts, it was generally taken as further proof of collaboration.

Later that afternoon a patrol came upon two civilians, a Mr & Mrs Smythe who were had
been captured by a Grant patrol these were rescued by the patrol and returned to base
where they were disarmed. Mr Smythe seemed very protective of a video recorder and
demanded a receipt for it. In Mr Smythe’s possession was a London Metropolis Police
side arm according to Mr Smythe he had taken it from a Grant during his escape. Both
claimed to be tourists from Dawn and were unable to account for their general lack of
provisions and living state given the hostility of the terrain. Mr Smythe’s video tape was
not examined. Both seemed keen to get off planet as rapidly as possible, they were
later arrested and removed from base by local Federal Police.

While the Smythes were being interviewed Amos Grant turned up drunk after “Cracking
open a still’ | am unaware of any information that may have been provided by Mr Grant
at this time as | was interviewing the Smythes. It would appear that a member of the
Grant family had become involved with a member of another Clan while “Fishing”.
Fishing was later discovered to mean "on the pull”.

One patrol intervened in a confrontation apparently between the Douglas and Plougher
Clans both exchanged fire with projectile weapons leaving two dead a member of the
Douglas Clan was arrested however there was insufficient evidence with which to hold
him.

Towards sunset the wife of one of the Grants turned up at base looking for him, he had
apparently gone fishing. Apparently the woman had been a hostage and was able to
provide details of where she had been held. | took a recon patrol to the location and
found a number of abandoned temporary shelters guarded by a sentry gun. The site
was left undisturbed as out patrol deadline was close. On return to base the recon patrol
lost contact with the backup unit and came under ambush. Two marines were sent back
to base under covering fire while the remainder of the recon unit pulled back to woods
to find the main patrol. The main unit was under attack from one or two heavy weapons.
The whole patrol moved back to base to report.

As cover a fighting patrol had been setup to provide a visible cover / diversion for the
patrol. This unit had come under fire from hostile forces, the situation was exercibated
by a number of disruptive elements within the recruit intake which had been integrated
into the patrol.

Major Haris took an unprecedented move in calling all officers and NCO’s together in a
general meeting in the Marine barracks, it had turned out that a number of incidents had
been attributed to a small clique of recruits including friendly fire on guard patrols. A
decision was taken to reiterate the importance of playing with the team in a debrief
which was carried out immediately.

An intelligence briefing was taken to determine what information was at hand on the
location of the hostages, during this time it became apparent that a 4th unaccounted for
party was involved, either officers and men from Major Flanks unit or more likely an off
world interest. At this point a radio message was intercepted from an unknown unit
preparing to pull out. 3 locations were given for equipment one of which co-incided with
the position of the hostages / sentry gun found by the recon patrol. The other two were
an uplink station 100-150m from the sentry gun and a drop zone 250m from a watch
tower toward the front of the base.

A simultaneous 3 pronged assault was mounted to hit each objective simultaneously.
My platoon was tasked to take out the sentry gun on basis of experience. | had done the
initial recce and | had also disarmed a sentry gun on operation Cyclone.

The teams tasked with dealing with the uplink and sentry gun met light resistance the
uplink was destroyed by a demolition charge set by the hostile forces and the sentry
gun was disarmed and returned to base. A number of explosive charges did go off in
the area however no command system or personnel were found. The sentry gun was
dismantled and returned to base, it was later found to have a defective traverse motor.

The assault team on the uplink captured one prisoner who claimed to work for a drug
company, | did not partake in the interrogation due to other duties | did not get the
company name. The unit assaulting the DZ met heavy resistance in the form of APDs
and heavy weapons the whole unit was taken down and captured. A radio message
was received from MFC Chaos to the effect that they had not had their screens reset.
Direct radio contact from the hostiles prohibiting a rescue, Major Haris and | both
agreed that in the position of the captured patrol, I'd least want to know that we'd tried
hence a rescue operation was launched.

No resistance was encountered until entering an area of scrub behind the remains of a
tower at the front of the base. The area was roughly divided into two by a thick hedge in
the middle of an open area with a 2-3 gap defended by the enemy. At the time of
approach two enemy were tending a downed man on the centre of the open area. They
informed us that one of our patrol had died due to IR and that they would kill the rest.
After some negotiation they agreed to return some of our men for their man and would
allow us to recover our dead. When | sent two unarmed men over to recover the body
there was an explosion where the body had been booby trapped. The hostiles came
forward with Marine Bean, checked the downed marines and re-issued their demands
whereupon they shot Bean using a slug thrower. After further negotiation a medic was
permitted to come forward to render assistance, Marine Axe volunteered for the
mission, she was not prevented from carrying out her task. The two men sent to recover
the body returned having suffered only concussion. An exchange was carried out when
four marines were returned.

A debrief with the captured marines revealed that the hostiles had been trading drugs
with the Grant clan and had a shipment ready to leave. A number of threats had been
issued to get information from the marines but these had been resisted. The person with
the slug gun was identified as a man about 1.8m tall, 80kg with light hair and a
moustache. At this point a number of recruits who had previously been noted as
potential problems were classed unsuitable for active duty and arrangements were
made for their transfer off planet.

Further kit inspection found an improved state of affairs in the Marine's barracks. MFC
Dibbly showed up as a disruptive influence wearing unauthorised kit on inspection with
intention of “pulling faces at the officers”. Mst Sgt Gibson and Sgt Apone were able to
provide MFC Dibbly with a number pointers on how he could improve his appearance
and set an example for others to follow. MFC Dibbly’s attitude since promotion has
become increasingly belligerent taking personal pride in giving PTI for infractions of
Medical and IR safety, | would recommend that in future that all such infractions should
be reported to the CMO / duty officer for further review.

During the course of the morning our remaining missing troops were exchanged for
medical supplies. MFC Chaos was able to provide the location of the new landing zone
for the hostile’s shuttle. | was tasked with putting together an ambush to take them out.
A recon section was tasked with setting up an APD command detonated by the tripwire
while the main assault unit took up position. | was able to check the ambush was hidden
before taking up position, the signal to assault was the APD detonation. Approximately
ten hostiles were caught in the ambush the APD did not seem to have a significant
effect. The assault started well but, as usual stalled under fire giving the enemy time to
regroup. | was taken down at the edge of the assault attempting to take a unit round
behind the enemy to encircle them and cut off their retreat. The enemy were able to
breakout from the area without their supplies, a follow up assault took them out, | was
unable to participate having sustained 3 broken ribs, apparently from the boot of one the
hostiles. Instead | secured a rear ERV with Sgt O’Shaunassy looking after the wounded.

The recovered supplies were returned to base where they were destroyed by device
inside one of the crates, there were no casualties.

### Summary.

Each family on Nyytoda is out to improve it's position and control by trying to wipe out
the other two. They are all ready to deal with off world forces for better equipment,
supplies or support in order to achieve this aim and only bargain from a position of
strength or defeat. This was obviously spotted by the drug dealers concerned who took
hostages and offered terms which the Grants seem to have taken, how much of this
Major Flank knew is unknown. The Grants negotiated from a position of strength with
Major Flank, weakness with the drug company, either way a deal way struck to their
benefit. The hostages from the Douglas and Plougher clans have not been returned and
the situation on planet is likely to escalate and become more ingrained with each
generation. It would appear that further UW intervention may be required to stop the
feuding and possibly find the hostages, or at least learn their fate.

The effort each family currently expends fighting each other could be put to more
productive use if they would cooperate, unfortunately cooperation is a word missing
from their dictionaries. The possible toe-hold is that the Grants fear that the Douglas’
and Ploughers would band together to wipe them out, if the other clans hold the same
fear it may be possible to convince each individually that this is about to happen. We are
giving the particular clan the exclusive privilege of joining as a balancing force because
we don't want to see them wiped out (which is the truth) in the new alliance.

On offer we have agricultural machine parts, mineral fuels and other commodities they
need in exchange for a market for the excess goods they are likely to produce. The risk
is that all three may attempt to gain an edge by attacking the talks in order to prevent
the other two clans making the alliance. Security could be provided by giving each
representative a Marine escort and holding the talks in orbit. The hard part is convincing
them that there is something in it for them in the first place and that it won’t compromise
the relative security of each family. As it stands the conflict is likely to go on until one
family is left however long it takes. Getting over three generations of armed conflict will
be problematic at best.
