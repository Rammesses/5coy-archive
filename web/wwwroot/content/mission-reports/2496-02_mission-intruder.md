Report Filed by: Calvin. A.T. Captain CA110328

### Mission Background

A raid on a SF regional base had uncovered details on a project Gemstone involving
CMC special forces, Restryk Corporation and a substantial UW budget. Further
information suggested that this project had involved a planet named Homeworld on the
rim. All other information on this project had either been destroyed or had maximum
security clearance. On prompting a data search Via IRAG the codewords came back
rated White security, a previously unknown series in UW / CMC classification.
Homeworld was known to be home the Amish Christian Religious sect, believed to have
originated Netherlands, Earth, Sol around the 16th Century, the sect made two
migrations, first to the United States, Earth, Sol 17th Century then to Homeworld early in
the 21st Century.

##### Mission Objectives:

- Re-establish contact on Homeworld
- Undertake recruit basic training duties.
- Investigate SF / Restryk activities and report information back to
command

##### Command Staff:

- Calvin, A, Captain
- Turner. J 2nd Lieutenant (Acting)

##### CMO:

- Dibbly. D Sgt(Medical)

##### Casualties:

None

##### Operational Structure:

Operational structure consisted of 4 fire teams, in two squads of ten, with a command /
security team at base, the squads consisted of two oversize bricks lead by Sgt Martins
and Lt Turner and two standard bricks lead by MFCs Casselle and Havoc. On
completion of training the new recruits were used to make up these numbers assigning
one recruit in a buddy pair with an experienced marine.

##### Hostile Forces:

- Rystryk & Banodyne Corporation Security Teams

These units are placed together as they posed a similar treat to operations, to their
credit Banodyne attempted a negotiated settlement almost to the end. After initial
contact Restryk Corporation Security were consistently aggressive, responsible for the
kidnapping of a young girl and possibly the deaths of several local civilians.

- Puritan Insurgents

Evidence of Puritan infiltration to the local community and the corporate teams was
confirmed by varying attitudes of Xenophobia. Evidence suggests that a long
established Puritan presence through the indoctrination of local thinking and direct
action against the GEMs. From unconfirmed reports it is estimated that the majority of
the GEM population had been betrayed to Puritan Cleansing teams which had
eliminated virtually all GEMs, including their offspring on planet.

- Amish Zealots

It is unclear whether the Xenophobic attitude shown by this group was home grown or
as a result of Puritan influence, given the weaponry being employed it is likely that these
groups may have been supplied by Puritan sympathisers. The Jihad was aimed at
removing all non-Amish from the world, including the CMC, Corporate security teams
and the GEMs, also regarded as outsiders and abominations. Unfortunately this force
had no training and poor equipment, a few were revived and returned to their
community, without weapons or screens. Many losses were suffered by this unit due to
screen failures or a lack of medical assistance. Aid was finally refused to reviveable
attackers when medical supplies became critical.

##### Neutral / Friendly Units:

- Amish Population

The majority of the Amish population were peaceful and highly religious, to the point of
putting aside their distaste for violence in the name of their God. The general attitude
was anti- technological and in modern terms both chauvinistic and xenophobic.
Relations with this group remained cordial throughout contact despite a great deal of
strain prior to extraction.

- WWW News / CNN News

The fact that two news agencies were able to get on planet apparently ahead of the
CMC by hacking UW library indicates that either the CMC Net is still insecure or that
they were tipped off. In general the behaviour of these groups varied from inquisitive but
controlled in the case of WWW to blatantly obnoxious in the case of CNN. The CNN
reporters were forcibly ejected from base having been taken in on safety grounds. One
reporter was unscreened and issued with an IR-CIV (Ser: CMC45G2-2000742) which is
to be invoiced to CNN.

- Gem Population

The remains of the GEM population were being sheltered by some of the Amish, having
converted to the religion, the events of the mission, actions by Puritans and the calling
of a Jihad against all outsiders effectively destroyed this association. It is likely that the
Jihad will eliminate the surviving GEMs in hiding Amish society being too closed for
outsiders to exist in for long without detection.

### Planetary Conditions:

The actual designation of Homeworld remains white security clearance and therefore
can not be quoted at this classification. Despite being in a Winter orbital position
Homeworld was fairly temperate, maintaining average daytime temperatures between 2
-6 C. HR readings taken on the first patrol showed a low reading.

### Mission: Day 1 - 12/02/96

All teams were dropped to planet, combat teams going in first to provide cover for the
recruits, the march into base was uneventful we were greeted at the door by three local
representatives who were keen that we should limit our operational area to avoid
contamination of the ground by our presence. Their overall conduct was friendly
however a degree of hostility was directed towards Sgt Mexal and Marine KShell
dubbing them as Devil Spawn. Additional concern was also shown of the presence of
female marines as serving members of the unit | did not contradict a statement made by
one of their number who showed me a large communal barracks area as the womens
quarters in an attempt to be diplomatic. The representatives were keen to assure us that
the people we had come to evacuate were all dead and that our presence was therefore
pointless, they also seemed keep to place a time limit on our stay at a maximum of 14
Hours due to the contamination of our presence.

sergeant Mexal established a temporary power supply for the building and established
full IR screening for the main assembly area and quarters. A preliminary patrol was set-
up to establish the perimeter and take a HR reading taken once a satisfactory result has
been recorded the recruits were released from base for training, by Marine Saint.

At about 11:30 Hrs the perimeter guard witnessed what appeared to be the abduction of
girl observed by a group armed men some 150m from base, no action was possible due
to the range involved and the possibility that the girl may have been unscreened. Rules
of engagement also applied in that neither the base nor any patrols close to it were
directly threatened by this group. A request to change the Rules of Engagement to allow
action against similar acts to protect local population, this was granted at COs discretion
only.

The base was approached by a single, armed individual towards mid day this person
did not respond to repeated challenges and, in a rage, opened fire, fire was returned
however this had little apparent effect even after screen failure, this individual was
engaged hand to hand and finally stopped when hamstrung and overwhelmed with IR
fire. Subsequent medical readings showed a strong pulse and a falling IDP reading. The
individual eventually came around without medical assistance other than treatment to
his leg wounds. On regaining consciousness the individual identified himself as Luke, a
local who was looking for his daughter who had been kidnapped. His attitude at this
point appeared to quite calm and passive and even apologetic in contrast to his earlier
state of rage.

At around mid day contact was made with a group identifying themselves as Restryk
offering to remove us from planet when pressed they asked if we were GEMs before
pulling out in haste. These troops later returned attacking the perimeter guard, a full
armed response was mounted which repelled this attack. At around 12:30 one of the
original welcoming committee a Mr Armstrong returned alone stating that the
abominations were still on planet and that they were ageless he attempted to offer
details on the whereabouts of these people so that we could take them off. Before he
could identify these people he was attacked and killed by Luke in a fit of rage despite
the attempts of four marines to restrain him. Later, once calmed, Luke identified
Armstrong as the man who had betrayed his daughter, he showed no remorse for his
actions, declaring them divine inspiration, he was detained on a charge of murder, in a
stateroom made over to a makeshift brig.

Before 13:00 two civilians attempted to circle the base looking for a picnic area when
they were paid too much interest they went off, they were neither armed or screened
and were not interfered with by the guard duty other than a few questions to ascertain
their intent. Recce patrols were maintained around the base expecting trouble after
being cased by the two civilians, at 13:30 the base came under attack by an armed unit,
possibly Restryk security this attack was repelled.

After Lunch Marine Saint declared that recruit training had been completed, the recruits
were split and buddied with an experienced marine and squads were brought to full
strength. While recce patrols were organised a man claiming to be Abdijitaparov
Djamalodine from WWW News approached requesting an interview, his credentials
were confirmed with command however entry to base and an interview was denied. Mr
Djamalodine proceeded to follow one of the recce patrols out of base.
shortly after the last patrol had left the base was attacked by what appeared to be
Amish Zealots HQ security held this attack off until relieved by the returning patrols one
prisoner was taken who was subsequently released to the local community, his weapon
and screen retained, identified as coming from an old cache stolen from a disposal
dump. This attack was lead by a priest apparently unscreened despite being in an area
of heavy cross fire he did not appear to be effected even by direct fire.

At 16:35 an unarmed civilian was brought into base having been beaten by locals the
man introduced himself as James, he started that some of the locals had started to turn
against the GEMs when checked for concussion by asking his date of birth he stated
that he was born in 2427, in appearance the man was hardly a day over 20. Shortly
after a representation from the local community came to declare that our 12 hours on
planet was up despite having been dirtside for less than 8 hours, this was backed by
threats of increasing tension and the possibility of a Jinad against us.

This was followed by two GEMs, Kenneth and Christopher, giving themselves so that
we could all leave they declared that they were the only ones left on planet and were
keen to convince me that | could evacuate, they were placed with Luke in the brig for
their safety. While being secured a group of troops from Banodyne turned up to
interview the GEMs and offer passage off planet, their request was refused, their leader
backed off asking for a further discussion later, no threat was implied their departure
was unhindered.

Having already suffered the effects of |.R injury once G2 was updated and a request
was made to allow the Rules of Engagement to be changed by a senior NCO in the
event of my incapacitation. Extraction was also requested for 3 unnamed personnel.
The base came under a major assault from a large group of Zealots, many of the
screens hit failed causing the death of the wearer, under the circumstances, given the
resusitants used by the company it was not possible to check that all those.

After 18:00 an attempt was made to get Kenneth, Christopher and Luke off planet by
dropship, this was compromised by Luke dragging me on ship as the door sealed
having worked out that they'd been tricked | was set upon, at some point before
achieving orbit the ship was hit and went down. The subsequent events on the rescue
attempt are withheld pending an SIB investigation into charges against Sgt Martins, Sot
Dibbly, MFC KShell and Marine Fugazi.

On my return to duty | was informed that Acting Lt Turner had been med-evaced off
planet and that complaints had been filed against several marines, | was advised that
medical supplies were low and requested a med drop. G2 reported a track on a
Gunship that had attacked my shuttle a track was plotted to grid 2723 0208 where it
was expected to land a full combat patrol was put together to attempt to capture or
neutralise it. Over 20 minutes were spent searching the projected LZ | was about to
recall the unit when the ship was seen circling in, a hasty ambush was set- up on
several possible landing points and troops were engaged emerging from the ship. A
significant number were able to escape the area and were engaged by other units in the
vicinity those taken down were identified as Banodyne security. One unit lost recruit
Reed taken prisoner, after some negotiation by Marine Saint he was released, minus
weapons and screen. It is estimated that approximately 4 Banodyne troops escaped
from this action.

After our return additional fire was directed at the perimeter one prisoner was taken, a
member of a puritan hit team that claimed responsibility for killing virtually all of the
GEMs on planet, his unit had largely been destroyed by Restryk troops holding what he
called the last GEM, a small girl at an OP. He offered to give the position of the OP if we
would take it out, he was promised that we would attack it then confined in the Brig.

A combat patrol investigated the area and encountered a group of armed individuals
who claimed to holding a girl and threatened to kill her if we approached, from talking
with their leader it was clear that, although out of sight, she was being restrained and
there was reasonable cause to suspect that she might be in danger. The leader seemed
keen to talk in daylight, since we were unable to determine where she was being heid,
we withdrew. During the withdrawal she escaped, as the Restryk troops began to
search we moved back in and took them down. MFC Casselle located the girl and
returned her to base while the mopping up operation cleared the area, two troops were
taken prisoner and held under Diazamorphite until evacuated. On return we were
attacked by Luke who was restrained until reunited with his daughter.

### Mission: Day 2 - 13/02/96

On the second day the local delegation demanded that, in observance of their customs
we remain in doors, this was in the hope that our reduced presence would encourage
others to cease their activities. While in the process of explaining my concerns that this
would not happen, the base was attacked. Several attacks were made by Zealots lead
by priest, absolving them of their sins. This person was taken prisoner in an attempt to
appeal for peace in order to stop more of his people being killed he was eventually
released with a disarmed zealot, promising to return with the population of the planet to
destroy us. Notably this was the last Zealot attack experienced on planet !. Medical
supplies were noted as critical at this stage, G2 was advised of our status with a
repeated request for a Med Drop.

At 10:00 Hrs the SIB investigation team lead by Lt Rumpole (CMC SIB) and Lt Col
svejenson (CO UWRRB) entered base, | then chaired the investigation into the charges
against Sgt Martins, Sgt Dibbly, MFC KShell and Marine Fugazi. The minutes of this
hearing are withheld here subject to proceedings by SIB and the CMC Provost Marshals
Office.

A GEM, later identified as Captain Bryant entered base requesting extraction for all his
people, despite making several complaints against the UW and Special Forces, Puritan
influences, the actions of the corporate teams and the rising Crusade had made it
impossible for his people to remain, several having already been killed as outsiders by
Amish Zealots. A request to command was made concerning the handling and
processing of Captain Bryant and his people. Bryant was released with Luke and his
daughter to find the rest of his people.

Two journalists claiming to be CNN approached base expecting an interview, their
request had not been logged they were advised to make an appointment with CMC PR
Office. As one was unscreened they were admitted for their protection, on condition that
their cameras and note pads remain in their pouches. The pair became increasingly
belligerent and attempted to photograph and _ interview, they were instructed to stop,
when they ignored this request they were arrested. In the intervening scuffle a camera
was dropped and damaged, exposing the film. The pair were ejected from the building
but provided with an IR-CIV screen for protection.

New orders from the UW were delivered to me by Lt Col Svejenson, stating that the
GEMs on planet were to be evacuated, if they could not be evacuated they were to be
eliminated as wall as any other organisation which attempted to take them. | issued new
rules of engagement to cover these orders and explained the situation to the company,
while the legality of the orders were reviewed by command. Sgt Mexal immediately put
down her weapon and stated that she was not able to accept our new orders and was
relieved from duty. At this point the T.O. Log could not be manned full time, eventually
resulting in unsatisfactory event logging, this was reported to G2 by Lt De Lima on SIG-
024, effectively closing the log.

Several requests for update on medical supplies were posted with no response
forthcoming.

Lukes daughter turned up with another GEM looking for Luke apparently he had gone
missing subsequent investigations revealed he had been taken hostage by corporate
troops, possibly Banodyne. In putting a combat patrol together Sgt Mexal was noted as
being absent from her quarters and Sgt Martins was not at his post. When asked
nobody knew of their whereabouts and a search was mounted in the immediate area,
finding nothing.

The patrols reformed into a combat raid to rescue Luke from the Banodyne security
team this raid successfully destroyed this force and recovered Luke. Shortly after out
return Sgt Martins returned with Sgt Mexal, Martins was immediately arrested for
desertion.

Under the leadership of Bryant the remaining GEMs came into base requesting
transport off planet, unfortunately while requesting transportation they were able to
ascertain their status both as former SF members and possibly as GEMs advised by
command they immediately attempted to leave by force to go underground or recover
an old weapons cache, as the building was screened we were unable to stop them by
IR fire and physically incapable of restraining them. In the scuffle Bryant was taken
having noted during the shuttle rescue attempt that one dose of Diazamorphite was
ineffective to restrain a GEM, a double dose was administered, regrettably this proved
to be fatal. G2 was advised of the situation regarding the escape of the GEMs and
reminded of our request for medical supplies, on requesting a general medical status
the unit was declared unfit for active duty and withdrawn.

### Unit Performance:

Given the requirements of the mission the overall performance was good, the recruits
faced with a difficult mission integrated very well into the unit, although this is as much a
commendation on the flexibility of the regular members of V Coy as anybody else.
There appears to have been a serious lack of control by some marines during the
shuttle rescue, this appears to have been an isolated incident. The actions of those
involved can only be sanctioned or punished following a full SIB investigation. The
actions of Mexal and Martins are also subject to investigation although | am
disappointed that either party did not feel able to consult me beforehand.

### Conclusions:

The original Gemstone experiment carried out 120 years ago appears to have produced
a being, which while long lived with varying resistance to IR is basically unstable. In the
aggressive state there appeared to be no amount of self control equivalent to a berserk
rage. In the passive state the GEMs were highly unwilling to contemplate aggressive
behaviour and even showed some suicidal tendencies in their psychological make up.

Whatever genes were modified they appear to be regressive, Lukes daughter showed
no signs of the |.R resistance or enhanced constitution displayed by her father. The
combat potential of these people is questionable, faced with a being that may be
effectively immune or highly resistant to Incapacitating Radiation may produce a
battlefield scenario where projectile weapons would be deployed to counter such a
threat. This could lead to the collapse of the Projectile Weapons Treaty and the wide
spread use of destructive weapons technology.

The remaining GEMs have gone into hiding presumably with their ageing weapons
cache, the impression | was able to obtain is that this cache is considerable being
based on Special Forces tactics prior to the implementation of the projectile weapons
treaty. Flushing this unit out by force will be costly in terms of personnel as well as
material, particularly given the mental disposition of the GEMs, their training and an
apparent wish not to be taken alive. These factors are over and above the situation on
Homeworld the local population were prepared to put aside their prejudice against
violence to remove us from planet. Under the training available to the GEMs if the
Zealots take arms with them then any unit attempting a landing could face a Holy War
waged against them,potentially with projectile weapons. Despite Puritan indoctrination
several GEMs have taken the Amish religion, at least one may have been a priest
leading an assault against V Coy. All further contact with the Amish will need to be very
careful to prevent full scale war.

In essence the information gathering objective was achieved. Captain Bryant was able
to fill in the pieces on Gemstone and the subsequent events. The GEMs (Genetically
Engineered Marines), being basically passive were put against the full array of SF
weapons and tactics at the time. They did not make good troops, being unwilling to fight
initially then going into an uncontrollable rage. When the experiments ended they were
imprisoned for some 40 years then written off by the CMC and dumped on Homeworld,
where they were hunted down by the Amish as abominations against God until they
took up the Amish beliefs. The reopening of the Gemstone file has basically traumatised
the survivors of this group to a state of suicidal dispair. It is my opinion that the CMC
and the UW would benefit by returning to the stance of having finished the experiment
and allow the surviving Marines to live out their retirement unmolested.
