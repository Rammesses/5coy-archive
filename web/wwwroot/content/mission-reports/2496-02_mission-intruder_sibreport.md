##### Present:

- Colonel J. Svjenson, CO CMC Rapid Reaction Force (observing)
- Captain A.J. Calvin, OC 5 Company 4th Field Regiment CMC (presiding)

### Introduction:

The Board of Inquiry was convened to conduct a preliminary investigation into an
incident occurring during an active service mission which could lead to three Marines
facing charges of first degree murder.

The accused are:

- Sergeant Duane Dibbley.
- Marine HRH Prince Grendel Fugazi of Avalonia.
- Marine Kayshell Dumasin Klay Togin.

All are serving members of 5 Company, 4th Field Regiment CMC; which was engaged
in Mission “Intruder” on Maine at the time in question.

The main objectives of the Inquiry were to determine what took place; the reasoning of
the individuals involved and their understanding of the situation surrounding their acts.

### Inquiry Transcript:

The first witness called was Marine Kayshell Dumasin Klay Togin.

To clarify matters, | began by asking him to explain the objectives of the patrol during
which the incident occurred. He stated that the patrol had been ordered by Second
Lieutenant Turner with the aim of recovering Captain Calvin who had been involved in a
dropship crash. Second Lieutenant Turner was in command in Captain Calvin's
absence. Orders were to proceed to the dropship’s last known co-ordinates as soon as
possible. Hostile forces were believed to be present. Marine Klay Togin could not recall
the specific Rules of Engagement for the patrol; but assumed that those previously in
force (i.e. only fire in response to direct attack) held good.

At the crash site Captain Calvin, the dropship pilot and three people whom Marine Klay
Togin described as “creatures” were still within the dropship. A skirmish ensued, during
which Marine Klay Togin was involved in engaging and pushing back the aggressors.

Once the crash victims had been treated, the patrol began to move back to base, still
under fire. Marine Klay Togin described his position as “the back door’, i.e. he was to
the rear.

During the return to base, Marine Klay Togin encountered Sergeant Dibbley treating
several Marine casualties, apparently sustained during combat with two of the
“creatures” who were also down from IR. He stated that Sergeant Dibbley told him that
Second Lieutenant Turner had sustained serious throat injuries and was in need of
immediate medivac. The orders were to get all Marines on their feet and to move out.

Marine Klay Togin examined the “creatures” prior to departure, finding that one had had
his throat cut. From previous encounters with these or similar “creatures”, Marine Klay
Togin believed them to be capable of regeneration and that what to most people would
be a severe injury did not incapacitate them. Although both “creatures” were at that time
still immobile, he decided to ensure that they could not arise and attack the Marines
again. To this end, he decapitated one “creature” - the one whose throat had already
been cut - and began to sever the head of the other. At this point, he was ordered by
Marine First Class Cassel, his squad commander, to desist, which he did. The patrol
then returned to base.

The next witness called was Marine HRH Prince Grendel Fugazi of Avalonia.

Marine Fugazi stated that he agreed with Marine Klay Togin’s account of the patrol and
did not wish to add to it. He believed the Rules of Engagement to be that if it were
absolutely necessary, i.e. aggressors not being affected by IR or demonstrating powers
of regeneration, the use of combat knives and physical force was authorised. During the
patrol, his squad commander was Marine First Class Cassel, and the unit was under the
command of Second Lieutenant Turner; however he described the command structure
as being “flexible”.

During the return from the crash site to base, Marine Fugazi encountered what he
described as an “incident”. He heard a call for a medic, and found that there were a
number of casualties, both Marine and aggressor. Medics were in attendance. He
described the situation as a “cluster fuck” [a term that | believe refers to inappropriate
grouping of personnel in a combat situation] and stated that “The people in command
were not doing their job’.

Marine Fugazi stated that the order to move out was given by Sergeant Martins (who
had assumed command once Second Lieutenant Turner was injured). No order was
given concerning the injured aggressors, whom he believed to be “GEMs’”, and capable
of regeneration.

As the patrol moved out, Marine Fugazi stated that Marine Klay Togin was ahead of
him. He saw Marine Klay Togin strike one of the “GEMs’” two times in what appeared to
be an attempt to behead him. Marine Klay Togin was then ordered to leave. Marine
Fugazi then examined the “GEM” and came to the conclusion that Marine Klay Togin
had inflicted injuries which would be fatal to a normal human being; and which in his
opinion would cause severe pain - and possibly a lingering death - even to a being
capable of regeneration. As a result, he administered a coup de grace.

In response to a direct question, Marine Fugazi stated that he believed that that
individual posed no threat to the Marines at that time.

The next witness called was Sergeant Duane Dibbley.

Sergeant Dibbley stated that when he arrived at the crash site, Captain Calvin had
already been treated with diazamorphite; and that his intention was to administer the
same drug to the three “humans” in order to get them back safely. He stated that the
“humans” had beaten Captain Calvin and that he knew that they were hostile.
Eventually, diazamorphite was administered to two of these individuals, and the other
was being watched. [Diazamorphite apparently slows the nervous system, sending the
recipient into a coma which lasts up to 24 hours. If not resuscitated by then, the patient
will die.] However, the two who had been dosed with diazamorphite began to recover.

The patrol was preparing to return to base, and Sergeant Dibbley stated that he “let
them go’. Although he believed them to be a threat, they were unarmed and he felt that
they posed no immediate threat and would leave. In his opinion, they were of the same
kind as an individual whom he had witnessed crushing someone's throat with their bare
hands; and he felt that there were not sufficient Marines, drugs or physical restraints to
control them. Hence he told them to go away; and they left. At this time they did not
have any weapons or screens. Sergeant Dibbley stated that he made this decision on
his own initiative. Second Lieutenant Turner was rushing around and it was impossible
to consult him. The dropship pilot had gone into shock as a result of injuries sustained in
the crash, and Sergeant Dibbley did not wish to delay further.

During the return to base, one squad under the command of Second Lieutenant Turner
was in the lead, followed by Sergeant Dibbley and those assigned to assist the injured.
sergeant Dibbley explained that he had suffered a leg injury during the original landing
on Maine which had reduced his capabilities - for example, he was not able to carry
casualties himself.

En route, the patrol was attacked. Sergeant Dibbley stated that believed the aggressors
to be the same individuals whom he had sent away earlier; although he only actually
saw one of them. He was able to make a positive identification of this individual, who
was attacking Marines with a sidearm. He did not know where the sidearm had been
obtained, but thought that it might have been removed from Second Lieutenant Turner,
who had been physically attacked. The aggressor was not wearing a personal screen
but did not appear to be affected by IR. AT this point, only Sergeant Dibbley and the
dropship pilot were still on their feet, and the location of the other squad was unknown.
sergeant Dibbley reiterated his belief that it was not possible to render him harmless by
means of IR or drugs; and in the light of this belief decided to kill him. He effected this
by cutting the aggressor’s throat with a combat knife. The other squad arrived at this
point; and Sergeant Dibbley turned his attention to the Marine casualties.

The final witness was Marine First Class Cassel

she confirmed that she had ordered Marine Klay Togin to desist from his attempts to
decapitate the second “creature”; and that he had obeyed the order.

The formal proceedings were then closed, and the Colonel and | prepared to return to
the Garavaglia. While we were waiting for a dropship to be called, | was approached by
Sergeant Martins. He told me that when he arrived at the site of the incident, two of the
GEMs were lying on the ground. One had had his throat cut, and Sergeant Dibbley had
stated that he was dead. The other was lying face down, having been hit over the head
by Sergeant Martins. Both Marine Fugazi and Marine First Class Cassel arrived on the
scene after he had done.

### Conclusions:

My conclusions and recommendations are as follows:-

##### Marine Kayshell Dumasin Klay Togin

believed that he was acting in the best interests of the Colonial Marine
Corps; as previous encounters with the individuals known as
GEMs has shown that they were extremely resistant to any
form of physical injury and that they had displayed considerable
aggression towards the Marines immediately prior to the
incident under investigation. So he had deliberately decapitated
one (whose throat had already been cut) and was about to do
the same to another, but stopped when ordered to do so by his
squad commander.

My recommendation is that Marine Klay Togin should be reprimanded
for the use of excessive force; but that no further action need be
taken against him.

##### Marine HRH Prince Grendel Fugazi

saw Marine Klay Togin attempting to behead the second GEM and
heard the order to desist being given, followed by an order to
move out. On examination of the body of this GEM he had
concluded that even if he was able to survive the injuries he
would be in

considerable pain; moreover he believed the injuries to be mortal. He
did not believe that the GEM was a threat to the Marines at this
time; but administered a coup de grace to spare the GEM
further suffering.

My recommendation is that Marine Fugazi should be charged with
murder in the second degree and with disobeying orders.

##### Sergeant Duane Dibbley

believed that he was acting in the interests of the Colonial Marine Corps
as he had already sent the GEMs away once but they had
returned to attack the Marines; furthermore he did not believe
that it was possible to neutralise the threat that the GEMs
posed by more normal means (i.e. IR, drugs or physical
restraints). Once he had made the decision to kill he did so as
swiftly and painlessly as he could.

My recommendation is that Sergeant Dibbley be reprimanded for the
excessive use of force and for exceeding his personal authority;
but that no further action need be taken against him.
