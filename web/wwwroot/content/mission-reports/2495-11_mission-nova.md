Report Filed by: Calvin. A.T. Captain (acting) CA110328

### Mission Background:

The UW Rapid Reaction Battalion (UWRRB) created by Col A Gillham has in the two
years since it's formation performed beyond the expectations of command. As such the
need for a special forces unit has become more and more questionable, given SF
operational procedures and practice. The UW has taken the decision to disband the
existing Special Forces structure in favour of the RRB as more controllable unit. In
recent months some SF units seeing their role diminish have mounted an operation on
Liahn at the rim of UW influence under the guise of a prolonged survival exercise
against invading UW units. It is believed that they are attempting to influence the Liahn
government to secede from the UW and establish an independent world.

### Mission Objectives:

Locate and destroy renegade Special Forces acting outside UW jurisdiction on planet
Liahn. Where possible effect the capture of said forces and return SF operatives to UW
custody for trail. Normal rules of war are to be observed.

lf necessary inform local officials of the actual nature of SF operations on planet and
warn them of their intentions. Special Forces have invited several press agencies on

planet the operation is to maintain a low profile until such time as a formal statement to
the press can be formulated.

##### Command Staff:

- Calvin, A, Captain (Acting)
- B’Stard, Officer Cadet
- Turner, J, Sergeant

##### CMO:

- Dibbley, D, Cpl (Med)

##### Casualties:

- Sylvia Domminic (Civilian)
- MFC Angel,M,I. KIA

##### Operational Structure:

With 18 Marines available, the company was split to 4 fire teams of 4 marines leaving
two additional marines to supplement up manning levels to cover losses and occupied
marines.

##### Hostile Forces:

- Former UW Special Forces Units.

As advised by command the main hostile force consisted of former UW
special forces units, notably Bravo company. In the course of
operations approximately 30 SF personnel were accounted for,
most suffering fatal injuries from screen failures. From the
statement given by some captured Marines other units may
have been ordered to participate in the “Exercise” without
knowledge of SF intentions careful questioning of all captured
suspects will be required.

There may also have been renegade UW Intelligence officers on planet
and possibly corporate or organised crime operatives in contact
with special forces, these contacts can not be confirmed as they
were not noted directly and were advised by suspect contacts
(UWI Agent Anderson & Marine Deacon).

##### Neutral / Friendly Units:

- Local Civilian Population.

Most of the local population contacted were farmers or miners and
generally unconcerned with the operation, it was initially
necessary to advise colonists away from “exercise areas” as
the operation was a live fire exercise and therefore of lethal risk
to spectators.

- CNN (Celestial News Network) News Crew

Of the media agencies involved only one CNN news crew was
encountered, CNN were very helpful in assisting the operation ©
despite the inconvenience of their presence for an interview on
the last hours of the Marie Celesta. CNN's assistance helped to
break the hold the SF units had on the local community and
force them to move out of their positions, overall a good
example of press co-operation.

- UW Military Intelligence

UW Millnt unit were notified as being on planet, no information was
available on the number or identity of operatives on planet.

### Planetary Conditions

Liahn, typical to many M class worlds has a temperate climate, typical daytime
temperatures were in the region of 8-10°C. Operations were hampered to an extent by
higher than average rain fall which resulted in a high rate of screen failures, fortunately
we were able to obtain a forecast from Garavaglia’s Meteorological Office indicating rain
allowing additional screens to be taken on planet to allow for failures.

The CMC base on Liahn was in good repair, screens, light, heat and power were
operational although | have reason to believe that the base had been used by SF, this is
unsurprising as they are likely to have had access to the same entry codesas regular
units.

### Mission: Day 1. 10/11/95

The company was dropped by both of Garavaglia’s drop ships. Drop ship 1 was
provided with a combat team to secure the LZ and hold for Drop ship 2. En route the
ship was attacked and also made a landing in what appeared to be an SF ambush.
Drop ship 2 landed at a pre assigned alternate LZ / rally point from which a counter
attack was launched. With the exception of Marine Doe all marines in the first drop had
been taken down when we arrived at the scene the SF units had withdrawn. Medical
attention was given to the casualties while my unit held off harrying attacks from 2 - 4
armed hostiles

Further attacks were made en route to base, the unit coming under effective fire on
several occasions, no further casualties were taken the intruders were pushed off while
the base was searched and secured. Sgt Turner altered the combination on the
electronic lock to the armoury and medical cabinet.

Shortly after set-up three representatives from the locals community showed up to
introduce themselves during their visit the base was attacked and these were moved
into the base for shelter until the attack was pushed off. They were asked to about the
SF “exercise” and expressed no concerns over their safety or interference from SF
units, a request was made to arrange an interview with of their councillors to explain our
involvement in the “exercise”.

Patrols were set-up to check out near settlements and the surrounding area operations
were hampered by SF units using small scale harrying tactics, no information or clues to
the areas of operation were gleaned by the patrols, all hostiles taken down having
suffered fatal IR injuries due to screen failures / faults.

At about 13:00 Hrs one agent McDonnald turned up on base claiming he was from
Military Intelligence and had infiltrated with the SF units on planet. The operation was
under the command of a female officer who was in contact with up to four news. The
special forces operation had established a good relationship with local citizens and had
already had close contact with several councillors via hearts and mind campaign, bribes
or threat had “significant influence” on the council. The operation was being funded by
trading with a civilian organisation possibly a Mr Fharqhar, presumed dead on Connet.
McDonnald stated that our arrival had caused a great deal of disruption among the SF
teams on planet.

When questioned on special forces equipment he claimed that in addition to the long
arms and light support weapons encountered they may also have access to biological
and chemical weapons such as nerve agents. Regular supplies were made by
registered cargo shuttles “bouncing” below starport radar to drop sites. McDonnald
offered to show a recon team to a fixed communications array being used by Special
Forces, unable to prove McDonnald’s identity this information was taken as being
reliable.

Prior to lunch a representative of CNN arrived requiring an interview with 5 Coy and the
survivors of the Marie Celeste. McDonnald asked not to be introduced as this may have
blown his cover and was ushered out. After questioning the CNN technician on his
access to an public broadcast uplink, interviews were arranged with several marines.

In general the interviewers line of questioning was both aggressive and unsympathetic,
in the case of MFC Cassell the questions asked were highly insensitive despite having
asked the reporter to clear her questions with Cassell first.

Despite the attitude taken by the news crew | took the opportunity to give CNN an
“exclusive as it happens story” on the situation regarding the Special Forces operation
on planet. The purpose of this broadcast was to advise the council, were not
approachable at the time of their position, disrupt any working relationships that special
forces may have had with the civilian population and warn the civilian population of the
very real danger from exchanges of fire in the “exercise”.

Mr McDonnald returned shortly after the CNN crew left base, a recce sent out with Cpl
Beck in charge he was advised to be careful, and that we could be being set-up, while
aware of the risks involved | had hoped that Beck would be able to get out any trouble
with a small unit and come back with some information.

shortly after the departure of the recce unit, MFC. Deacon turned up on base asking if
wed seen McDonnald. Deacon then confirmed my suspicions that McDonnald was
probably a plant, Deacon was able to indicate the position of the ambush for a rescue to
be mounted.

The rescue team came under heavy fire at the position of the ambush however the
hostile forces were driven off. Two of the recce squad had suffered physical injury from
knives and or gun shot wounds requiring the position to be held whilemedical attention
was provided in situ during which time SF mounted a counter attack, this was repelled.
Recruit Bear had suffered knife injuries to the hand and MFC Rockstanski had been
shot in the leg by a slug thrower. Mr McDonnald was also found at the scene tied to a
tree dead from a gun shot wound to the chest.

Having moved the wounded back to base a Councillor Domminic turned up from the
local community wanting details of our operations, having seen our CNN newscast. |
was able to convince Councillor Domminic as to the validity of our mission and show
him my orders requiring the arrest of the special forces units on planet. Councillor
Domminic stated that he would call a general meeting of the planetary council within the
hour to discuss Lihan’s position. He was provided with an escort to his home, further
protection was refused.

Five company also suffered the unique experience of being raided by the DEA, they had
received a tip off that there were drugs on base. They were allowed to make a search
on the basis, that the base was either clean as expected or a quantity of illegal
substances had been planted. After finding a quantity of ampoules close to the medical
store a number of marines were questioned regarding the search. They were advised
that should they wish to press charges they would need to apply via the CMC Courts
Martial.

several hours after Councillor Domminic’s departure his Grand Daughter turned up on
base looking for him, he had been expected to come to his son's house, there had been
no sign of him for several hours. Search parties were sent to check with local
communities and the surrounding terrain to no effect other than continued contact with
special forces units in the areas of search. Councillor Domminic grand daughter was
returned to her family but came back around 40 minutes later, given the lateness of the
hour she was asked to take some dinner prior to being returned home. During dinner
she managed to slip out of base, most likely with a change of guard.

After an extensive search of the area under hostile fire for both people, MFC Deacon
was found at a local miner's hut and was able to position an OP where Councillor
Deacon could be held and offered to look out for his grand daughter.

Further contact was made through a Councillor Malcombe who had come to base to
express some concern over the disappearance of Councillor Domminic, he confirmed
that a Video conference had been organised by Domminic which he had failed to
attend. Councillor Malcombe provided additional assistance in stating that Domminic,
like all of the early colonists had a PDT implanted. The PDT signal was tracked to a
remote area, despite a weak signal indicating transmitter failure orphysical injury.

The company was able to rescued Councillor Domminic in a prolonged firefight at the
indicated position, again because of the need to treat wounded the hostile forces were
able to regroup and counter attack, this was pushed off but delayed the location and
treatment of early casualties among them was MFC Angel who was not resuscitated in
time. His squad leader Officer Cadet B’stard indicated that body was not found where
he’d Angel seen go down.

The unit was ambushed on return to base with no loss close to recreational centre being
constructed by one of the local communities. At this point or during the rescue several
things appear to have occurred, one or more marines appear to have been using knives
to administer the “coup de grace” on downed hostiles, | discovered this on checking one
of the downed troops for ID. Also a consignment of unregistered resuscitants appears to
have been found and exchanged hands. This resulted in a smear campaign against
those concerned by other members of the company. While giving the debrief it was
necessary to remind the company of their obligations and have a private word with a
number of individuals.

### Mission - Day 2 - 11/11/95

After reveille patrols were restarted resulting in the capture of two special forces
operatives, regrettably one suffered an allergic reaction to the resuscitants and may
have died as a result, the body was returned to the Garavaglia for a full post-mortem.
Sgt Turners patrol continued their sweep and were ambushed and taken down.

The captured patrol was offered in exchanged for one of the SF Prisoners, which was
agreed despite the presence of unscreened personnel Mexal attempted ambush the
lead negotiator on her own while returning the prisoner, and, unsurprisingly was added
to the number of downed personnel.

MFC Deacon was contacted a final time requiring evacuation as he thought his cover
may be blown when questioned about the reaction of Special Forces to resuscitants he
warned us that their medical was critical most were overdosing on Cyclazine. He
insisted on being allowed to leave alone to clear some things up, he was later returned
outside base by a Special Forces unit who attempted to execute him, and was
evacuated off planet. 

Close to midday Councillor Domminic entered base with the body of his grand daughter,
he was understandably upset and vented a good portion of his anguish on me
personally. After calming him | reiterated the opinion that people were ruthless and
made a promised to bring those responsible to justice.

A second Mil Int, operative entered base, codename SCRATCH he was able to confirm
his identification with the G2. His information indicated ground contact with a shuttle
picking special forces units up. G2 was advised of the information and asked for air
support / orbital interdiction.

An assault was launched on the position indicated after a dog fight between one of G2's
gunships and an unidentified gunship protecting the shuttle.

In the fire fight the cargo shuttle’s pilot was shot with |.R. preventing take off one
conscious prisoner was taken and a quantity of ore later identified as Bodonite. The
prisoner a offered his medical services and information regarding the operation and
funding of the SF operation. The informant is not named in this report for security
reasons. The informant claims at fist only to have been involved at a peripheral level,
actually not knowing what was going until to late and yet knowing about the Bodonite,
the bank account and about marketing the ore with his Dewitt experience, my own
tendency would be treat some his claims with a deal of scepticism.

Having regrouped the unit came under attack from a Gunship this was eventually shot
down in a wooded area on arrival at the scene the pilot was found dead. his description
matches firearms owner given by Rockstanski although no firearms were recovered
from the wreck. Before if burst into flames. Five operatives were taken from the wreck of
which 2 died of internal injuries shortly after. One prisoner of the three survivors
matches that of person who cut off Bears fingers.

### Unit Performance:

In all good, there still seems to a problem on stalling in combat meaning that squad
leaders end up with no support in advances. Treatment of wounded needs to be
revised, if possible medical attention should be set in a defensible ERV as soon as
possible after taking a position with patrols out to warn against and push off counter
attacks.

### Conclusions

The operation on Liahn was not the most tidy, this is due in part to the Special Forces
training to cover their tracks, remove IDs and confuse the trail for “Plausible
Deniability”. Information was scant and hard to come by. The death of Sylvia Domminic
is a great tragedy and may, with hindsight, have been avoidable.

The main question is the disbandment of SF and it’s effect on future operations are
operatives to be redeployed in the CMC or demobed. In the latter case my concern is
not so much the number of disgruntled and unemployed Ex Special Forces operatives
on the loose. But the corporate and fanatic terrorists who may decide to employ their
Skills against us.
