### Situation

Whilst in transit, a detachment of Marines from 5 Coy 4 Fid Regt were tasked to form a
boarding party for a civil starship (reg. ‘Marie Celeste’) observed to be in distress. No
communication was established but sensors were detecting life signs, as well as
vacuum and HR areas internal to the ship. The ships owners, Hadens-Worthy, were
unable / unwilling to pass any useful information.

### Mission

To board the vessel to render assistance.

### Execution - Overview

The party consisted of 20 marines and was inserted via docking umbilicus at approx
1030hrs 27/05/95. The following conditions were found:

* Passengers and crew were found to be either dead or in a state of
mental illness to varying degrees.
* The ships computer network was inactive.
* Hostile mercenaries were present on the ship.
* One of the passengers had established himself as a self styled crime
lord, known as ‘Tech’, enslaving a significant proportion of the
survivors.

Additionally, shortly after the boarding party entered the ship, its anti collision program
cut in causing it to begin manoeuvring away from the ‘Garavaglia’, causing
disengagement of the boarding umbilicus to be essential.

Through out the entire time the party was on board, there were numerous firefights with
the mercenaries mentioned above, as well as problems with the automated security
system which the ‘Tech’ had gained control of.

T/Sgt Mexal eventually managed to reboot the computer system, the intention being to
disable the ships manoeuvring thrusters, however upon reboot the ships JSE drive
started to prep for jump, the parameters of which were unachievable and would result in
the ships destruction. All the terminals were locked out of command mode and we were
therefore unable to control any ships functions.

Inspection of the ships passenger lists revealed that two Hadens-Worthy employees, a
Ms Housenons (Area Manager) and a Mr E K Arnold (Design Engineer) were on board.
We attempted to locate them to ascertain whether they knew any override code or could
otherwise assist. It transpired that Arnold was the ‘Tech’, he was eventually captured
and Ms Housenons was located.

By use of an experimental mood altering drug located in the cargo manifest, these two
were returned to sanity. In spite of their assistance, we were unable to stop the ship
from jumping although we were able to gain access to one of the Emergency Escape
Vehicles (EEVs).

When it became apparent that the ship was going to jump, | ordered the unit to
evacuate to the EEV. As we approached the airlock the unit came under fire and in the
resulting firefight | was incapacitated. In the resulting confusion most the unit along with
3 civilians, (Housenons, Arnold and 1 other) boarded the EEV, although three members
of the unit, Sgt Trader, Acting Corporal Ratch and Marine Jarvis remained behind (See
annexes).

The EEV was ejected at approximately 1445, the ‘Marie Celeste’ was seen to explode
42 seconds later whilst attempting jump. The EEV was recovered by the Garavaglia
shortly thereafter.

### Recommendations / Further Information

1. The cause of the mental state of surviving crew and passengers was
not determined. Recommend ail unit + Survivors to be
quarantined for sensible period or until cause established.

2. Recommend MFC (acting Corporal) Ratch to be confirmed Corporal
(Posthumous).

3. Recommend all information to be forwarded to Space Accident
Investigation Board. All CMC + Civilian survivors to have full
debrief. T/Sgt Mexal to make separate technical report. In
particular, cause of insanity and cause of condition of ship need
to be determined. If there is the possibility that the cause of the
accident was either negligence or experimentation, recommend
that responsible Hadens-Worthy executives are charged within
the extent of the law.

4. Obstruction by Hadens-Worthy of our requests for data regarding
‘Marie Celeste’ were without doubt a contributing factor in the
deaths of the 3 CMC as well as numerous passengers and
crew. Recommend that regardless of outcome of investigations
above, that this be pursued as a separate example of culpable
negligence, responsible parties to be charged with
manslaughter.

5. Survivors need full evaluation, in particular E K Arnold. Medical
notes showed that body builds up resistance to the mood
altering drug, therefore prospects of long term recovery appear
to be slim. Recommend Arnold needs to be either certified or
charged.

6. A large amount of currency was recovered. It has been counted by
myself and Officer Cadet B’Stard and secured in CO’s classified
document safe.

7. | hereby file notice of intent to initiate salvage rights on the currency
as well as the recovered EEV, interested parties being the 17
surviving members of the boarding party and the dependants of
the 3 marines Killed In Action.

8. Recommend decorations for valour as detailed in annexes A, B & C.

1ST LT Oslo has recommended Marine Jarvis, Sergeant Trader and Cpl Ratch for
