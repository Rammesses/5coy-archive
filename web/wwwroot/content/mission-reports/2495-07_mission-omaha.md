Report Filed by: Calvin. A.T. Captain (acting) CA110328 Â©

### Mission Objectives:

Mission briefing was given by Major Zwalf, who announced acting ranks for the mission,
following the loss of Major Harris. The mission was an official operation to support rebel
forces on Hal by providing escort for three CMC covert operations specialists and their
equipment. These operatives were to act as training officers for the three main rebel
forces known to be operating on planet. Their objective was assist in the training of
rebel troops and attempt to help them form an alliance.

These operatives were:

- Lt Churchill
- Lt Winter
- Lt Knapp

##### V Companys objectives were:

1. Provide escort and protection for training officers and their equipment until contact had
been established with their appropriate units. Main and alternate RV points had been
established as:

- 2213 8663 (Main)
- 2228 8692 (Alternate)

2. Retrieve Data from rebellion forces for further analysis.

Orders regarding contact with Hal Regular Forces were that they were to be neutralised
with extreme prejudice, Major Zwalf later clarified this by saying to kill them.

##### Command Staff:

- Calvin, A, Captain (Acting)
- Oslo, S, Lieutenant
- Turner, J, Sergeant
- Schwartzkopf, MFC (Acting)

##### CMO:

- Mimiannapandawawa, Cmdr (UW Navy)

##### Casualties:

- Churchill, J, Lieutenant (CMC Covert Operations). KIA

##### Operational Structure:

Given the small number of marines available the unit was organised into two fire teams
lead by Sgt Turner and MFC (Acting) Schwartzkopf. Lt Oslo and I operated as a Hotel
brick with Cdr Mimiannapandawawa and Marine Fugazi in support. The structure was
chosen to give more NCO experience to Turner & Schwartzkopf which could be backed
up by either Lt Oslo or myself, Marine Fugazi was used as a loose cannon to buddy
either Lt Oslo, Me or provide extra support to each unit. This position appeared to suit
Fugazi who is still having problems trying to adjust to a position as a regular soldier.

##### Hostile Forces:

- Hal Armed Forces (HAF)

Two units of Hals armed forces appeared to be operating in the area,
the 49th Unified and the 12th Cohort, we were unable to
ascertain the full unit designation of the 49th or its position
within the larger organisation of a Cohort or Legion. The 12th
Cohort was commanded by an Ensign, and is therefore likely to
have been equivalent to Platoon or Company strength. From
the numbers encountered and reported | would estimate that
the Hal Army was at regimental strength in the area. Reports
indicated 100+ reinforcements. Since no large body of troops,
staging areas, transport convoys or depots were found, | am not
in a position to confirm this information.

The morale and motivation of these units varied, the general impression
gained was that of a conscript army, unused to heavy or
determined resistance though a number of units showed
greater tenacity. Equipment was a mix of light and heavy
weapons with military screens.

- Slave Security (SS)

Slave security did not pose a major threat militarily, most operatives
were illiterate and undisciplined. Rank appeared to go the
biggest bully in any unit, main motivation seemed to be
monetary, collecting bounties on run away slaves. Typical
equipment was military screens and side arms however the unit
was unused to opposition.

- Slave Owners

The slave owners presented a few problems mostly in trying to recover
lost slaves or sell slaves to the units in the area. From
discussion with rebel forces a popular Hobby appeared to be
slave hunting using shotguns, this would constitute a direct
violation of the firearms treaty, which | understand from earlier
operations, Hal has signed!.

##### Neutral / Friendly Units

The three main resistance forces were the:

- FFF (Freemen For Freedom)
- HFA (Hal Freedom Army)
- SFF (Slaves For Freedom)

The make up of each was different, the FFF were all Freemen and the
SFF were all former slaves. We were unable to ascertain the
makeup of the HFA, from their equipment it may be that they
were, like the last rebellion, ex- army. Typically equipment was
military weapons and screens with varying degrees of
camouflage or uniform, presumably captured equipment
although it can not be discounted that some units were supplied
by sympathisers in regular units left over from the first rebellion
in April 2494. (xref: Mission Ogre).

Neither force trusted the other, each suspected the other of selling out
to the government in hind sight it seems likely that this stance
may have been created by Hal government infiltrators to keep
the factions apart and ultimately destroy them. General
motivation was high despite inexperience, particularly among
the SFF who had nothing to loose.

- UW Colonial Intelligence Agency

The CIA appeared to have infiltrated the slave security the operatives
encountered were helpful in tipping us off to when our position
became compromised. The operatives contacted indicated that
they been on planet for over two years this could indicate that
the CIA may have known about operation Ogre. The operatives
refused passage off planet, preferring to organise their own
extraction.

- Cyber Knight

Surprisingly Cyber Knight was found on planet in the company of the
FFF having been missing for over 12 months. His debriefing
was conducted by Sgt Turner using a data down load to Sat
Turners portable terminal. A personal assessment of Mr Knights
condition is that he will require extensive advanced medical
care before returning to duty. | would further request that given
the sensitive nature of operations, Mr Knight is either formally
requested to join the CMC or denied access to the G2 and
CMC operations.

### Planetary Conditions

The area of operations was highly agricultural, consisting of mixed woodland and open,
cultivated fields. Local cultivation centred on wheat, root crops and sheep.
Environmental conditions were, as expected from experience on Mission Ogre variable
though less extreme. Air temperature and climate were uncomfortable at times
favouring warmer temperatures, equivalent to sub-tropical conditions or temperate
summer conditions.

No HR reading was taken or demanded current data being up to date from Ogre.

High temperatures and humidity contributed to some screen failures and dehydration /
exhaustion problems in the squad. In general the civilian population was quite
militaristic, most of those encountered were screened and a high proportion appeared to
be armed with military style weapons.

Hal forces made heavy use of air cover, orders were issued to avoid detection, this did
not prove to be a problem on the first day due to low cloud cover, on the second day
cover seemed to be lifted in favour of ground troops.

### Mission: Day 1 (15/07/95)

A prearranged RV was agreed prior to insertion as a meeting point for all teams. The
company was dropped in three runs by an adapted shuttle, no restraints were available
to prevent personnel hitting their heads on the ceiling during turbulence. After insertion
the units formed up as a single force and prepared to move to the Main RV, to set-up
camp. Resistance was encountered, one figure in black, no |.D attempted to assault the
unit. This individual was not taken down he managed to evade by going to ground.

Camp was established and a defensive perimeter assigned, on the basis that numbers
were short no wide ranging patrols were established. Our training operatives advised us
that we would probably have to wait for contact. A guard duty was assigned to the
perimeter. A runaway slave entered the perimeter soon after set-up, a team brought him
into camp. The man showed signs of having been beaten recently, he claimed only to
be No 49 from a breeding house, and that he had run away because of maltreatment,
he was offered medical assistance and food and eventually named Harry by the unit in
preference to a number.

Our first contact was with a Mr Head of the FFF, Mr Head was alone having evaded a
Hal army O.P. on his way in. He was introduced to Lt Churchill, who had been assigned
to his unit. Mr Head expressed the opinion that he would be unable to sneak around the
O.P. with Lt Churchill and his equipment. After some discussion a fighting patrol was
organised to take the O.P. A small guard was left with Lt Knapp and Winter in case any
other rebel units attempted contact in our absence. The O.P. was approached and
flanked before being taken out, a radio was found after a search and removed. The
troops stationed at the O.P. were despatched, captured weapons & screens were
handed over to the FFF.

On return to base, 4 slave security were encountered when they started asking
questions as to who we were it became necessary to order Tech Sgt Mexal to silence.

On the basis that they may have blown our cover and their insistence to return Harry to
his owner we tried take them out. Two were taken down by myself and Mexal shortly
after Cpl Martens handed me a note from one of them stating that he was CIA and to let
them through. Medical aid was provided and an argument was staged for the benefit of
the remaining SS who then left. The full details of the note were:

"Hello V Corp., I'm CIA let us go through."

Warning one of rebel group infiltrated the operative concerned stated that he would
come back later with more information, if he could get it.

One representative of the HFA turned up at around 17:30 he was introduced to Lt
Knapp and provided with his assigned equipment. The representative asked for
assistance to take the equipment back to his camp. Marine Fugazi helped to move
equipment out and hand it over to another 4 members of the HFA waiting in cover. 2
Slave hunters attempted to bounce the unit, these were armed with |.R weapons and
were taken out by Fugazi in hand to hand combat before they could do serious damage.

A patrol was sent into the area to sweep for further hostiles and cover the departure of
the HAF.

A sniper/spotter was seen operating in an area of relatively dense woodland east of our
position. Sgt Turner took his team out and neutralised this threat, one Hal regular was
taken down, no sign of a buddy backup was found. En route back Sgt Turner picked up
two representatives of the SFF on their way into camp these were introduced to Lt
Winters and shown their equipment.

During the time the SFF representatives were in camp a group of 6 slaves approached
offering their services and were turned down. In camp they recognised the SFF
representatives and attempted to leave and tell the authorities, the SFF opened fire on
them killing all of them before action could be taken to prevent bloodshed or convince
the slaves that the SFF representatives were Prisoners. The SFF delegation were
invited to leave with Harry and their training representative.

After the departure of the SFF the patrols were reset, shortly after the base was
attacked by 2 fire teams of the Hal regular army, both were taken down without loss.
One Prisoner was taken, CPO Tomkin, of the 49th Unified. Under the Treaty of Venus
CPO Tomkin would not provide any additional information and was detained as a
prisoner of war.

Considering our position to be compromised, or poor at best | requested contact with
the G2 for extraction orders and / or further instructions. We were ordered to stay put to
collect the promised data disks from the rebel forces in the area.

Early evening Mr Head (FFF) returned to base, apparently alone and unmolested with
two data disks, no information scanning or retrieval equipment was available these
disks were therefore secured with my mission notes. During his visit Slave security
returned, with a new leader. Mr Head was Arrested as a military prisoner to keep him
away from SS and provide a legitimate reason for his presence. We were advised by
the new acting SS contact that our original contact had been killed by other members of
his Slave Security unit. Our new contact claimed he had removed the killers and
reformed a new unit. A note was passed to me stating

"You are compromised. 100+ Regular Army moving into area now. I must meet you
no later than 16:00 Tomorrow at 2230 8635."

After a discussion of troop movements / rebel sightings the unit was allowed to leave
unmolested, Mr Head was released from custody and allowed to return to his unit. A
subsequent meeting was arranged for 15:30 the following day.

Having confirmed our suspicions that our position was compromised the squad was
ordered to break camp, the objective at this time was to set-up a new camp close to the
alternate RV to enable us to maintain contact with the rebels. Lt Oslo and Marine Fugazi
volunteered to take up a Sniper position to cover our position should we be attacked
before we were ready to go, we agreed on a rallying point at 2213 8683. During our set
down an SFF representative entered camp, seeing our position he offered to show us a
new position in return for retrieving two of his men from Hal Regular Army. He also
stated that a large force of Hal Army was close behind him. On agreeing to assist the
SFF, our guide, Simson wanted to leave immediately. As packing neared completion a
large unit with a support vehicle entered the field. The squad then withdrew into the
woods behind our camp leaving those supplies that could not be carried easily. CPO
Tomkin could not be taken with us, having been isolated, he was left for his buddies to
free and debrief. Later discussion with Lt Oslo and Marine Fugazi indicated that they
had managed to pin down or least confuse the main force while we made our
withdrawal.

simson lead us to a new position away from our planned RV, this appeared to be a
lightly manned HAF O.P. guarded by two men, the position was taken over as a
reasonably secure area to make camp overnight. On discussion of the location of Hal
Force holding his men Simson indicated that our original alternate RV was being used
as a OP. Since movement towards this position would involve going close to the agreed
rally point this was taken as a way point en route to the target. We were unable to locate
either Oslo or Fugazi at the rally point, a search was not made as the area was heavily
wooded and in line of sight of the enemy position. The decision was taken to search for
Oslo and Fugazi after making our assault. Fugazi met up with us on the way to the
target and was absorbed into my fire team.

The assault was taken along the tree line and split between two teams 50m apart to
avoid concentrating enemy fire. The assault took out 4 -6 Hal Regulars and recovered
the SFF radio men including Harry - at this point | was encouraged to see Harry
operating as part of the SFF. The actual assault managed to pin down enough Hal
forces to enable me to try and take a unit through the camp and overrun them from the
rear. A number of key components of the SFF radio was missing, a search was
mounted but revealed nothing. After the fire fight Lt Oslo was found, he had not
contacted us going in due to a down screen and had basically taken the sensible option
of laying low until the shooting had stopped.

Once the area had been secured, the SFF withdrew to search for their missing
equipment, they were allowed to take the captured HAF equipment to assist their
armoury. The squad marched back to base on an open road, hoping to pose as Hal
regulars in the case of any contacts, no further contacts were made. At base Cpl

Martens set-up the perimeter beacons and arranged the watch.

In debrief about the events after our withdrawal from the first camp Lt Oslo and Marine
Fugazi had withdrawn from their position after we had cleared the area, they then ran
into a HAF patrol and believing them to be V Coy challenged. In the ensuing firefight
Fugazi had seen Lt Oslo go down and had administered emergency resusitants, without
repairing the screen, which he was not qualified to do. They both attempted to break
free and had become separated, Fugazi claims to have come under fire and had
assumed Lt Oslo had gone down as he was unscreened, he then spent the remaining
time searching for the rest of V Coy. Meanwhile Lt Oslo had gone to ground hoping to
escape and evade. Lt Oslo is uncertain if he informed Fugazi of the position of the rally
point, under the circumstances no disciplinary action other than a reprimand was taken
against Fugazi for leaving his buddy.

### Mission: Day 2 (16/7 )

Cpl Martins reported a relatively quite night, only having engaged a couple of hostiles
probing our position, the decision was taken to break camp and keep moving in the
woods to avoid contact with the main Hal force only engaging targets of opportunity until
more information could be gathered and extraction arranged. 4 HAF Fire teams were
encountered and taken out before noon these were from the 12th Cohort & 49th Unified.
This latter unit included Harry, he was not revived for interrogation due to low medical
supplies, his position within a HAF unit appeared to indicate that he had been one of the
infiltrators in the rebellion forces. At each instance the HAF forces did not challenge
before opening fire, the basic policy seems to have been shoot anything that isnt us!.

One unit was found with Lt Churchill, a rescue was attempted, taking down all hostile
forces unfortunately Lt. Churchill, who was not screened was taken down in the
crossfire, despite attempts to revive him he died of his injuries shortly after medical
assistance reached him.

At this point the unit came under heavy fire from one or more Hal army units, despite
attempts to break contact most of the squad went down before this force disengaged.
During the recovery operation Cyber Knight came across the unit with a member of the
FFF who apparently had land in the area. The FFF contact took us to a Secure area to
rest up before our meetings, on approach two members of Slave Security were in camp
with a female slave, these were driven off by our contact, basically by bullying them.
The girl was freed and handed over to the SFF. Our FFF Contact informed us that the
army was engaged in a systematic search and destroy mission, isolating units and
taking them out one at a time. The FFF suspected that freed slaves in the FFF had
turned traitor and sold them out. A similar story was given by the SFF representative,
Simson, on our final contact. Both units were planning to lay low in the hills until things
quietened down. The message given to both was they had to work together and allow
an element of trust or the Hal Government would employ the same tactics to divide and
conquer if they rebelled again.

The squad moved to our final briefing with Mr Head (FFF) who was able to provide a
third data disk and confirmed reports that the army was succeeding in breaking up the
rebellion. Mr Head accompanied us to our meeting with the CIA contact. He had by this
time left slave security fearing his cover had been blown. We were informed that Lt

Knapp & Winters were also prisoners being held or picked up at map position 2215
8699 at 17:00. We left the CIA contact with Mr Head and moved to a new position to
rest and plan a route to the designated RV.

While in camp an unknown number of troops was heard moving through the woods
close to our position MFC Schwartzkopf was ordered to take point and evade the
contact to allow us to reach the plotted objective on time, since no further contact was
made this can be assumed to have been achieved. A coded message was transmitted
to the G2 for extraction at 17:30.

The squad arrived at the plotted R.V. early and took up an ambush position, no contact
was made, apparently a unit had crossed the tail of our line, this unit had passed out of
range before | could be informed and order an attack. It soon became obvious that our
position was wrong, the co-ordinates were replotted at the far north side of the clearing
arround the alternate RV. A search was mounted but no sign of any force was noted in
the area with the time approaching 17:30 we then withdrew to the expected drop site for
extraction, our primary objective being to return the captured data to the UW.

After further analysis of the original R.V a search of a wooded area north of the
alternate RV was suggested after a suitable rest for the unit. The G2 informed us that
the earliest radar gap in its schedule was 18:50, allowing enough time to search the
suspected target area, the extraction point was moved to the clearing around this
position. A search of the target area found a squad of Hal regulars with Lt Winters and
Knapp the unit was hit and after a prolonged firefight the area was secured.

Debriefing Winters and Knapp showed they had been administered drugs and had
confessed on video to being part of a UW unit assisting the rebellion, both required
assistance getting to the extraction point. Before the drop ship arrived, we were
engaged by further units of Hal Regulars, on this occasion it was possible to use our
position to hold these units back.

### Unit Performance:

The whole company that were present worked well, despite being short handed, the
team work shown will be a good building block for further improvement. Towards the
closing phases of the mission the combination of dehydration and fatigue reduced
performance, including my own. Overall | was impressed by the general conduct of the
marines in difficult conditions. They were in a position where they were a single squad
trying to do a job that should have ideally been done a platoon or company.

### Conclusions

It is quite apparent that the operation had been compromised at early stage, probably
before the G2 achieved orbital approach. Hal government security is obviously quite
alert to insurrection, any future rebellion, with or without UW support will need to
neutralise this organisation at an early stage.

From the point of view of objectives all goals were achieved, operatives and equipment

was delivered and information was retrieved, as a bonus both Lt Knapp and Winters
were recovered, though the video taken by Hal Forces may be politically damaging to
the UW. When considering its role in the galaxy and the affairs or other worlds the UW
may need to reconsider the approach shown on this and an earlier missions towards
planetary sovereignty.

On balance, at a personal level, | was glad of the opportunity to go back to Hal and help
the people that the company wanted to help the first time. In addition the opportunity to
take on the Hal Army on our own terms and cause them some damage went some way
towards repairing the earlier humiliation of having to surrender to them in April 2494.
