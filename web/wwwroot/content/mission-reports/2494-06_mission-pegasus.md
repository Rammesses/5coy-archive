### Planetary Conditions

NOTE: As recorded I/ater in this report planetary conditions concern Sirent Cing
X243.

Planetary conditions were generally warm although landing approach was delayed by a
regional space storm common to the Sirent Cing system. Of major concern was an
atmospheric taint or presence of a high level of background HR which had an
incapacitating effect on several Marines. Sgt O’Shaunessy was able to administer anti-
radiation drugs to all Marines on planet throughout the mission.

A major planetary hazard were the reported presence of an indigenous scavenger
described by several witnesses as large cat. Reportedly the animals are “Stretched out”
some 4-5m in length and capable of jumping some 8-10m. The creatures did not seem
overly aggressive preferring motionless targets opposed to moving prey as is the case
with Terran Cats, suggesting that the creature is a carnivorous scavenger rather than a
hunter / chaser.

### Mission Briefing

As on Ogre mission orders lacked issuing authority and included an error in the date of
operation, this may be a typo however it may also suggest continuing problems in the
UW COMNET Mail system.

The proposed drop and base camp setup was postponed due to the presence of a
violent storm in system. The UW survey pilot “Biggles” considered conditions to be too
hazardous to attempt an approach. Major Harris took the opportunity to discuss his
personal quest to locate the whereabouts of Sgn Lt Tane Diamond and asked those
present in the officers mess to continue the search in the event of his death. Once it had
been established that Lt Diamond had been a member of 5 Coy it was taken as read
that as duty to find out what had happened to one of our own.

### Mission: Day 1 - 25/06/94

On approach to planet the shuttle suffered several systems failures ultimately causing
crew and passengers to blackout. Pilot Biggles is to be commended on his efforts was
however able to regain consciousness and regain enough control to bring the ship down
safely.

On planet Dr Jones was able to identify the members of the first survey crew as:

- D. Saunders (Leader)
- B. Debanti (Geology)
- L. Kiotie (Bottany)
- O. Mc Donnald (Phys Science)
- B. Williams (Meteorology)
- S. Corrington (Medical)
- J. Khan (Security)
- J. Kandith (Xenobiology)

Mr Finch stated that a total of 10 Inter-Corp personnel had gone missing on planet but
was unable to provide a list of missing personnel. In maintaining conversation with both
Dr Jones and Mr Finch it became apparent that Inter-Corp had a financial arrangement
with Dr Jones, though this may have been no more than research sponsorship.

A preliminary reconnaissance of the area was insufficient to be able to orientate on the
available maps. After an inspection of the shuttle Dr Jones decided to make an aerial
survey of the surrounding area to locate one of the working beacons and gain a fix on
the map.

Dr Jones was accompanied by Capt Zwalf and a squad of marines to provide security.
Radio contact was maintained throughout the flight, approaching the beacon the shuttle
began to experience systems failures and control problems. Major Harris ordered the
shuttle back, however contact was lost soon after.

Assuming that the shuttle had gone down Major Harris used the company’s distress
beacon / locator to get a bearing on the shuttle’s beacon. A search and rescue team
was sent out to recover any survivors. The shuttle was located some 500m from base
an appeared to have come down hard, wreckage was strewn over a wide area however
all of the survivors were located together on a knoll close to the wreck site. Missing
were / of the survey team all marines were present.

Four dead were counted including :

- Reld, E, Marine.
- Crouch, C, Dr, UW Survey
- West, J, Dr, UW Survey
- Bowman, D, UW Survey.

Both Sgt Apone and Marine Blackthorne claim to have seen a fourth member of the
survey team, possibly Dr Locket, who disappeared or was dragged off by something, a
trail of blood was tracked going into a wooded area although a search revealed no sign
of a body. A number of personnel showed signs of having been cut or mauled by
something sharp although this could conceivably been caused by cuts sustained in the
crash. Marine Blackthorne maintained that Sgt Talim may also have been on the shuttle,
though no record exists of her on the mission log. No trace of the beacon was found,
although this was later traced to an inaccuracy in the nav system being employed.
Regrettably, due to the injuries of the surviving casualties we were unable to recover the
bodies of the dead.

On return to base we were able to over the mission map with Capt Zwalf and able to
ascertain that none of the geographical or artificial features on the map had been seen
from the air, it was assumed that the earlier systems failures experienced entering orbit
had put us off course from the target area. The following actions were prioritised:

- Map the local Area.
- Search shuttle wreck for recoverable material.
- Mount search and rescue patrols for survivors.

Against our advice Mr Finch took upon himself to try and contact the lost members of
the crew of an Intel-Corp ship listed as lost in system. Mr Finch refused an escort and
we were unable to find suitable grounds for restraining him in base.

| took the first patrol back to crash to check for wreckage, enroute | found the heat
shield, apparently from an M16/203 similar to my own rifle, some 400-500m south of the
crash site. By the leaves and dirt covering, it had been there for some time and was
therefore not part of the wreckage.

The squad took both a South - North and east to west sweep of the crash site walking
line abreast 5m apart, no salvageable material was found. Rechecking the area where
the dead had been left we noted that the bodies had been removed, only a few scraps
of cloth and human tissue remained.

On return the patrol went slightly south of it's outward route and came upon the remains
of an abandoned camp. In the area we found a remote command detonator and an
attache case inside a steel chest containing the remains of a number of documents that
the owner had attempted to destroy. A cursory glance at some of the fragments
included the name of Ex Col Nasco, | immediately sealed these away in the case for
return to base. Also were found 3-4 makeshift graves, 2 bloodstained stretchers, a
Brotherhood scarf and a sign scratched on cammo board saying “Welcome to the
Slaughterhouse’.

On return to base Major Harris was interviewing 3 civilians later identified as members
of the O’Donnald family. | was not party to the conversation preferring to take our
captured equipment directly into the command shelter. On securing the items away |
placed an immediate interdiction on the command shelter until the recovered items
could be examined. When Major Harris had concluded his interview we undertook a
thorough examination of the items recovered.

Only two documents were complete the remaining fragments appeared to be
communications between CMC station commander X243 and Col Nasco. The earliest
complete document was from Sgn Lt T.Diamond to Gen Sulivan with copies circulated
to Col Nasco. The main content of the letter concerned what Lt Diamond took to be poor
or substandard safety procedures on X243. The second document from Station
Commander X243 to Col Nasco concerned Lt Diamond’s recent transfer to base,
concerns over safety and imminent opportunity to test said equipment first hand. Both
documents were recovered from planet and are included in mission documentation.

During my debrief Major Harris was concerned about the reference to the
Slaughterhouse and the documentation on X243, subsequent to his own interview with

Mr O’Donnald, which had included a description of the indigenous life on planet, he
stated that Mr O’Donnald was convinced that we were on X243 and that the
documentation tied into his own investigations into Lt Diamond’s disappearance. Given
that X243 & X244 are companions in the Sirent Cing system we came to the conclusion

that it may not be unreasonable to assume that we had landed on X243. Given the
shuttle’s condition priority was to be given to salvaging the components to build a long
range communicator to advise Caravaglia of our position. | agreed to take a four man
patrol back to the Slaughter house to make a more thorough examination of the area
and attempt to locate any communications equipment.

The description of the dominant life form was that of a cat like creature 3-4m in length
capable of leaping 8-10m and very fast. From the description the creatures appear to be
scavengers rather than hunter / pouncers applied to Terran cats. The creatures will not
or are reluctant to take mobile prey and were attributed to several losses within our own
expedition as well as the other groups on planet.

shortly after this time the base and patrols began to encounter Brotherhood Guerrillas,
their reception to our presence was hostile, base and some patrols came under I.R fire
from Brotherhood patrols and raiding parties.

Mid-morning a civilian woman came into camp in a state of distress, she claimed to
have been with her boss moving towards our base when they were attacked by men
wearing scarfs. A patrol was sent into the area and was able to recover the body of Mr
Finch, it had apparently been mauled by a cat presumably after having been taken
down by I|.R. Despite contacts with Brotherhood, my patrol was ordered out immediately
to search the Slaughter House.

No contacts were made going out or returning to base, a search of the Slaughter House
site found little usable equipment on the ground although we were able to recover a
long range communications dish close to the edge of the site. Continuing attacks on
base by Brotherhood guerrillas had taken two casualties Marine Striker and Marine
Adder had both been taken by cats while incapacitated by |.R. Cpl Chaos had also been
taken but was subsequently recovered. A search of the immediate area found no trace
of the missing Marines although additional blood trails suggested that several raiders
had met a similar fate.

The Intel-Corp woman who had come into camp prior to my patrol, Ms Johnson, left
soon after the area had been declared secure to contact and return other survivors from
her ship. Shortly before Mid Day a lone individual was seen staggering into camp, when
challenged he was eventually able to identify himself as a 2nd Lieutenant with 3 Coy
having other duties on base security | was unable to participate in the debrief which was
conducted by Major Harris and RSM Honer. From what | was able to gather the man
had suffered severe memory loss and was the only survivor of 3 Coy rescue mission.
Due to his mental condition he was kept under sedation for the duration of the mission.

After lunch Dr Johnson returned with the remaining survivors of the Intel-Corp survey
ship. These included:

- S. Johnson, Communications Officer
- “Hawk’, Security Officer
- “Thatcher’, Navigator / Pilot
- 3 Persons, 2 Male, 1 Female called “Doc”

The Intel-Corp survivors were willing to cooperate in terms of trading information and
items for food and a ticket off planet. The first such trade was for a steel case containing
papers. These turned out to be fragments of a personal journal kept by Lt T. Diamond
and a number of personal erects, identified by Major Harris as belonging to Lt Diamond,
these items were salvaged from planet.

The journal contained a number of references to Lt Diamond’s concerns on safety
procedures and the apparent indifference of the station commander towards this
subject. The journal briefly touched on an autopsy carried on a cat, Lt Diamond was

of the opinion that the creature was of animal intelligence. In addition the journal made
several references to security, particularly the information system, Lt Diamond had
taken to writing her private notes on paper due to concerns over this matter. Few base
personnel were named except for one Alan Stevenson, a Med Tech working with Lt
Diamond who seems to have been a confidant.

The Intel-Corp team all seemed to be suffering from memory loss due to their isolation
they also treated people outside of their group with suspicion and would not allow
physical contact. Attempting to interview them was difficult, however they stated that
their original objective was to set up a communications base on X244. They had picked
up two beacons entering the system, by the time they had worked out they on the wrong
course they had lost control and crashed. They had also found the ruins of the testing
station base, from which they salvaged Lt. Diamond's case and other items. They had in
their possession a communications RT unit which they were prepared to exchange for
food and evacuation. They were unwilling to have any contact with the O’Donnalds,
branding them as liars / cheats. The origin of this feeling centred on several dealings
with them over the course of their exile.

Brotherhood probing attacks continued throughout the afternoon during which time it is
estimated that at least four hostile were taken by Cats. These culminated in a full scale
attack late in the afternoon during which the Intel-Corp group broke cover and were
taken down by |.R. Regrettably, Ms Johnson, Hawk and one of the male “Doc’s could
not be revived. The remainder agreed to go to their base for the coms unit and return,
each was provided with a military screen.

There were no further contacts until a patrol lead by Lt Oslo found Ms Thatcher beaten
and left for dead by Brotherhood guerrillas she was returned to base for medical
treatment. The Intel-Corp group had been ambushed and the com unit was taken
Thatcher was able to identify the position of the Brotherhood camp before being
sedated. The subsequent raid recovered the Com unit with 4 hostiles accounted for with
no further losses.

### Mission: Day 2 - 26/6/94

After reveille two members of the O’Donnalds approached camp, with weapons. On
being challenged they offered to trade part of a communications system they had for a
letter giving them passage off planet. They stated that the weapons they now
possessed had been scavenged from the Brotherhood camp that we had hit the
previous evening, since we did not have a complete setup and had orders to recover
survivors, Major Harris prepared a letter for the exchange.

As “a gesture of good will’, the pair handed over two more documents from the testing
station that they had recovered. Both were from Station commander X243 to Col Nasco,
the first reported the death of Lt Diamond while testing some form of Exo-suit, which
had apparently imploded after a power failure. The document also seemed to indicate,
in code, that the station personnel had realised that the station was being operated as a
form of prison and expressed security concerns. The second document referred to an
explosion in the base's main power system and a total failure of backup systems and
the loss of several domes. Both documents were recovered from planet.

| took out a four man patrol with the letter to exchange with the O’Donnalds, they offered
a charged stable power pack needed to run the RT unit in exchange for the letter.

Another patrol lead by Lt Oslo found a civilian close to the Slaughter House site during
my patrol. The recovered man identified himself as former test station Med Tech A.
stevenson. Mr Stevenson was able to lead us to a camp containing the remaining
survivors from the test station, he attributed their survival to the efforts of Lt Diamond,
however he maintained that she had died some weeks ago, falling victim to a cat attack.

On approach to the camp a number of screams were heard we then made a rapid
approach and took out 3 Brotherhood hostiles, capturing one of them. The survivors
were all tied to trees and being mistreated by the Brotherhood members present and
needed to cut free to effect medical care. Including Mr Stevenson all four survivors were
recovered Lt. Diamond among them. The Survivors were returned to base with the
prisoner. On return a lone Brotherhood member with a heavy weapon attempted to
ambush the company from inside the awning of one of the tents, | was able to gain
access from the side and neutralise him using a combat knife.

On questioning the prisoner we were able to ascertain the position of the Brotherhood
camp and the possibility that they might have a signal booster needed to contact the
Caravaglia. Conducting a personal interview with the man, a Mr Robinson, he indicated
that the Brotherhood had a regular supply run to the planet. He also indicated that he
joined the Brotherhood on Earth for financial motives rather than the higher cause
normally pedalled by Brotherhood members. Lt Diamond and Mr Stevenson were
provided with weapons and volunteered to provide base security while we raided the
Brotherhood base.

The raid was started as two overlapping extended lines although out of necessity for
speed of advance it became a running full assault. Approximately four Brotherhood
guerrillas were neutralised on camp, the area was checked for equipment and we were
able to locate a functional signal booster. During the clean up operation approximately
four more Brotherhood members attacked from the rear three were taken down while
the last was able to escape.

The signal booster was returned to base where | was able to assemble a complete
communications set which was used to contact the Caravaglia and advise the ship of
our position and local navigation hazards to enable a safe evacuation. A full list of all
survivors evacuated was transmitted to the Caravaglia prior to extraction.

On return the Brotherhood prisoner levelled several complaints against the surviving
testing station staff of maltreatment, when | entered base the prisoner was still under
guard in the command test where he had been left. Although | was preoccupied with
assembling the transmitter | not notice any signs of maltreatment.

### Conclusions

The Sirent Cing system clearly possesses a number of hazards to navigation in the
disruptive electrical forces surrounding X243 and X244 whether these are naturally
occurring phenomena caused by the interaction of the planet’s natural magnetic fields
or due to some other phenomena is a matter for further investigation.

The mission has raised more questions than it solved, there may be survivors of other
expeditions on X243 and X244, there is still the question of artifacts on X244 and the
purpose of the research on X243. It may be prudent to put the system under general
quarantine until these matters can be resolved or at least clarified. The electromagenitic
screening on X243 has served the CMC, Col Nasco and the Brotherhood in maintaining
covert bases adding further urgency to the need to investigate the system and monitor
traffic more closely.

The specifics of the mission highlighted a number of potential problems in placing teams
in high risk areas. The need for more contingency planning in terms of backup
communications and electronics being a major concern. Once again security on base
was a problem, putting together an effective fighting team, potentially compromises
base security although, as always, this is a balancing act for the unit officers.

General morale and team spirit was good, the officer / NCO training seems to have
prompted a number of Marines to consider their position as part of the team, to the
benefit of the Corps. Despite the last mission the course seems to have bolstered
morale.

The presence of the Brotherhood, their possession of base equipment and items found
with them at the station ruins, seem to indicate a connection with Nasco. Additionally
Robinson may also provide a clue to a change in operations. Robinson seems to have
been a hired mercenary indicating that the Brotherhood may have the resources or
backing to employ mercenaries. It may also indicate a need to supplement their combat
strength with hired guns due to a fall in popularity possibly as a result of their
involvement with the Chidanian’s on Groombridge.

Major Harris has suggested that the Brotherhood had been hired by Nasco to clean up
on X243. Robinson did state that they were ordered to kill Lt Diamond and anybody
found with her reinforcing this theory. This would indicate that the CMC may have been
mislead by Col Nasco about the research on X243, and Nasco may be possession of
it's results and possibly in a position to use it.

The other troubling fact is our own security, given that Nasco knew about the base it
would appear that he did very little about verifying it’s destruction until 5 Coy was sent to
the planet where upon the Brotherhood seem to have been given orders to locate and
destroy any survivors. It would appear that there is still a leak in CMC security and that
Nasco has a tap into it.

It is interesting to note that in gratitude for saving her life after infiltrating a top secret
mission Ms K. Spyers of Interstellar was able to provide Major Harris with some
information on Lt Diamond via one of her contacts, is it possible that this contact is the
same one that told Ms Spyers about Ogre and could this same person or persons have
other contacts such as Nasco. | would take this as further evidence of a serious problem
in CMC security.
