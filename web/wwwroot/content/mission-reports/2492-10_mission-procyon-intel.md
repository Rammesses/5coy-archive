### Memorandum - Classified

TO: General Sullivan - CMC Central Command
FROM: Lt Sgn Diamond, T

COPIES: Station Commander, Colonel Nasco - CMC Area Command
DATE: 20/10/91

SUBJECT: Accident Stats

| have been studying the type and frequency of accidents (both fatal and non-fatal)
since my posting to the Testing Station in July. After studying the official reports and
carrying out several postmortems, | have come to the conclusion that either safety
procedures are sadly out of date or that the equipment we are being supplied with is
severely sub-standard.

| have questioned ail personne! involved, but they are less than forthcoming, and
several seem actively paranoid. Coded with this transmission are the case histories of
the two most recent ‘incidents’ - which | think you will agree make disturbing reading.
Whilst | appreciate the need for thorough testing of prototype CMC equipment, | cannot
believe that failure’ rates should be this high.

| apologise for contacting you directly, but the Station Commander does not seem to be
concerned about this matter, and indeed has ordered me to cease such a ‘futile waste
of CMC time’. | have copied both him and Area Command as per standard CMC
procedure.

Whilst not wishing to disobey the orders of a superior officer, | feel it Ils my duty to bring
my concerns to your attention.

Thank you for your time.

### Memorandum - Classified

TO: Colonel Nasco CMC Area Command

FROM: Station Commander, X243

COPIES: Nane

DATE: 02/01/92

SUBJECT: Diamond, T

Further to my recent communique regarding prototype experience for Sgn Lt Diamond, I am
saddened to have to report that whilst she was undergoing training the exo suit she was
wearing suffered a partial power-pack malfunction, which caused the subframe to fracture and
implode. Due to the distance of the testing ground from the main dome (X-ref Station plans),
our med-tech was not able to reach the scene in time to save Diamond.

Unfortunately, I am unable to return the body, as the med-tech in question collapsed due to
shock, and by the time an Evac squad could be organised, the body had been removed by one
of this planet’s few indigenous life-forms (X-ref X243 flora/fauna).

The exo-suit was examined for any sign of what caused such a tragic accident, but due to the
implosion nothing has been found. Our Chief-tech Plimmers therorises that the power-pack
may have suffered radiation damage during its transportation here. (X-ref Regional weather/
*space storms’).

The Med-tech - Stevenson, A J has been reprimanded for his lack of control.
