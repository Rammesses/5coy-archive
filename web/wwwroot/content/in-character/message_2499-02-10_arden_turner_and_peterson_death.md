From the Chaplain

My fellow Marines.

With a heavy heart I have to record the deaths of two well-known and loved 
members of 5 Company: -

Lieutenant Joel Turner
Spec1 Olaf Peterson

Who both laid down their lives in the service of the United Worlds in the 
best traditions of the Corps.

Lieutenant Turner had been a member of 5 Company for many years, rising 
through the ranks to his last position as an officer, acting 2 i/c and a 
leading technical specialist particularly in the areas of computers and 
communications; skills recognised by his secondment to IRAG for several 
years. Competent in combat, a good leader and popular with the Marines, he 
will be sorely missed by all who knew him. His death was a tragic 
accident, a combination of misfortunes which have led to the loss of a 
most valued Marine and friend.

Spec1 Peterson joined 5 Company briefly during 2496, before returning to 
his previous position in a hospital ship. However, he yearned to return to 
active service, and last October was granted his wish with a posting back 
into 5 Company aboard the Garavaglia. An excellent field medic, whose 
'bedside manner' cheered many a resuscitated Marine, he never shirked 
combat and died as he lived: in the thick of things, protecting his unit 
with both his weapon and his medical talents.

All who knew Joel and Olaf mourn their passing. We pray for the repose of 
their souls, and that their sacrifice be not in vain.

Blessings be upon you all.

The Reverend Catherine Arden.
Chaplain, Garavaglia 2.
