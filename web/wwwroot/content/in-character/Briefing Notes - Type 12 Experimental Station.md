Type 12 Experimental Station

Overview:

The Type 12 Experimental Station is designed as a
fast setup base for experimental research. It can be

- dropped into its operational position from orbit within
a standard Mark Ill re-entry capsule, for which it self-
errects within 15 minutes.

Powered from an enclosed Type 3 micro-pile power
unit as standard, more permanent installations may
be supplied trom a Type 9 micro-fusion reactor
embedded 10m_ below the facility. In_ this
configuration, the setup time for the facility is
increased to 24 hours.

 

The Type 12 facility
i iS constructed from
Bia triple-wall
# | duroplast film,
a\ inflated by local
| atmosphere or
compressed alr
|} supplied from an
auxiliary cylinder.
| Airlocks on all entry
and exit points allow
the facility to be
used in most hostile
environments, even
(with special
options) on a
seabed in 50m of
water.
