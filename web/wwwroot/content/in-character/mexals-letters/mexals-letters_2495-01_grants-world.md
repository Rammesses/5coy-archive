John,

Here’s the latest intercept of Mexal “Letters Home". I don’t know exactly what’s going on with this one.
Have the Marines been taking drugs, or is there something going on here that we should know about?

Either way, the Kyoto lab has got the data and they’ll liase with your office direct is there’s anything of interest.

Tomas

##### Message Text Begins

To: The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From: Marine Mexal, on board the Garavaglia, in orbit around Grant’s World.
Date: 23-01-2495.

Greetings!

As usual, things have been pretty busy, but for once an active service mission has almost been a bit of a rest!
Not long after the Christmas Dinner, Colonel Svjenson gave me the task of writing a proposal document for
the establishment of a technical support group, which #% provisionally named the Combat Engineering
Department. So I have been quite busy putting together my ideas. The CED will cover armourers, comms
techs, sursat techs, computer techs and all the specialities dealing with explosives, so there is quite a lot of
work. Eventually this was all ready, and I was able to present the Colonel with the report. That task
accomplished, I was given the job of prepping the weapons and screens for the impending mission, which -
as they hadn’t been touched since the previous mission on Juliette - took a fair while. By then, however, I
was pretty tired of being cooped up on the Garavaglia. She’s all right as jump ships go - the habitat module is
quite roomy - but it’s not the same as being out in the open air.

Eventually, we arrived in the vicinity of Grant’s World, which is a Class M (but only just!) world being
prepared for colonisation. They are intending to put some of the refugees from Groombridge here, and the
colony prep is being paid for directly by the UW rather than by commercial sponsorship, as normal. The
CSD surveys are all done, the construction crew have been and gone, and the colony prep team itself has
been on planet for nearly a year. Haven’t been able to find out anything much about the place before getting
here, but it appears that it is fairly marginal, rather too cold for full agricultural productivity.

First thing when we got there we were all called together on parade. RSM Honer was in fine voice, and gave
the impression that he though everybody had forgotten what little drill they had ever known - correctly in
some cases! Lt. Calvin then turned up and announced that as well as a briefing for tomorrow’s drop, we were
to be treated to a couple of lectures on basic hand signals (from Captain Zwalf) and radio operation (from
Sergeant Turner). He then called my name, and once I had come to attention in response, told me to issue
screens and weapons to all personnel.

In developing my CED proposals, I’d been looking quite hard at what armourers have to do, including
weapon and other kit issues, and had worked up the relevant forms. Quite a few of the Marines were less
than impressed at having to sign for everything, but eventually all was done. Then we were sent into the
briefing room and Captain Zwalf went through the basics of hand signals in the field. All the usual stuff from
basic training, but just about everybody had forgotten something, and I think it did us good to have the
reminder. Certainly, during the mission, there was much more signalling than usual! We also had a lone
recruit, fellow named Reed, to whom this all was new. He seemed to be getting the idea pretty quickly,
however.

When he’d finished, Sergeant Turner took over. He handed out some very detailed course notes, and
explained that this, basic, radio operator’s course, was aimed at anybody who might need to use a radio.
There are five more levels of comms qualifications for those who are seriously interested; This was the first
presentation of the course, and they are hoping to make at least attendance at the lectures mandatory for all
Marines. There is an examination yet to come, but only those who wish will be required to take it. I shall,
although I have no intention of being a radio operator.

Anyway, the course began by defining a radio operator as anyone in possession of an active radio transceiver,
and then went on to list the various types of communications equipment available and to cover correct voice
procedure. Things like the phonetic alphabet and how numbers should be pronounced for greatest clarity - I
had to demonstrate this by calling out my ID code - MX110424 as “Mike X-ray wun wun zero fower too
fower”! Then there are various codes, callsigns, and the correct way to send a situation report or sitrep.
Those without good memories were beginning to look a bit dubious.

When Turner had ended by making us hold conversations radio-style - which caused quite a lot of
amusement - Major Harris arrived. He asked everybody who had not been present on what he referred to as
“the recent training exercise” to leave the room. Once they’d gone, he said that he had a few comments to
make, based on what he had been told, and that “this conversation has not taken place”. Then he told me not
to take notes, so I closed my notebook, and was just about to put it away when Captain Zwalf snatched it out
of my hand and said he’d give it back later. (Which in all fairness he did, but gave me great offence by his
action, asking me not to do something is quite sufficient.)

The gist of the matter appears to have been that he’d heard rumours that some of us had overstepped the
mark in our dealings with people we’d met. He mentioned the killing of civilians - that, I thought, had been
covered by the orders we’d been given at the time - and the ill-treatment of prisoners. I can’t comment on
what happened to one of them, but the other wasn’t harmed.... true he did not like being in close proximity to
an elf, but that doesn’t rate as much hardship, surely? Otherwise, Harris continued, he was very pleased with
our performance. Then Calvin said that he wanted to raise a couple of minor administrative points, nothing
to do with the “training exercise”. These turned out to relate to Chaos and Martins... and I reckon had
EVERYTHING to do with the so-called training exercise! Apparently, Chaos has been due to undertake
officer training but this has had to be put back, and Martins has been found to be less well-qualified than he
should be for his rank of sergeant and consequently as been demoted to corporal. Chaos seemed
unconcerned, but Martins is decidedly less than happy!

Not sure all of what is going on, but the levels of secrecy surrounding the Juliette mission are unparalleled.
Even Interstella - a single copy had been nailed up on a bulkhead, the normal delivery had been delayed -
claimed to have been subject to censorship... and I thought the only thing that could silence Krystal Spyers
was laryngitis! I guess this non-existent conversation and administrative problems with people’s ranks is the
High Command’s way of dealing with events they disapproved of without having to make formal charges
which would have had to go on record.

After this mystifying chat, everybody was called together for yet another parade, at which Colonel Svjenson
made an appearance. He announced that there was growing concern that the current drugs were not totally
coping with the effects of IR on such as combat troops - who naturally encounter rather a lot - and so the UW
had instigated a research programme, in which we were to take part. A senior medical officer from the
Colonial Navy has been assigned to us to take charge, and she was then called in and introduced herself as
Surgeon Commander Mimiannapandawawa... everybody gasped at that name and I guess most were relieved
when she continued “But you can call me Ma’am”. Even Colonel Svjenson decided that was easier than
attempting that mouthful!

She told us that a new monitoring system was to be introduced, and that we all were to be required to carry
special cards on which our exposure to IR would be logged. They are using some kind of coloured dot
system to show how much people have had, and as the levels increase so will the seniority of the med-tech
needed to treat it. It seems that I have been adjudged more sensitive to IR than the humans, my card was
loaded to show a lesser tolerance to exposure than the others. It’s true that I always need large quantities of
resusitant drugs, although once treated I am up and about as fast as any. Cyclazine seems to hit me fairly
hard, but that’s all. Maybe it is characteristic of our species, that we are actually more sensitive to IR
exposure. We’ll see - maybe the more intensive monitoring will reveal any differences.

That dealt with, we were all sent back into the briefing room and Colonel Svjenson talked about the mission
we were about to undertake. The Marines have been called in by the Colonial Survey Department, who seem
to have been making their usual mess of things. As I said earlier, Grant’s World is being prepared to accept
colonists, and presently is occupied by the colony prep team, who are undertaking agriculture trials, setting
up irrigation systems and other infrastructure and doing everything necessary to make the place ready for
those who will live there. This takes about a year, then they remain with the fledgling colony for a further
two years, helping them to make a start. The prep team consists of ten people, who between them have most
of the skills necessary, and they work to contract, paid on completion of three years’ work and the successful
establishment of the colony. This one is a bit unusual in that they have been contracted directly by the United
Worlds - mostly, the planet is put up for tender, then professional colony prep team leaders tender for the task
of setting up the colony, then organise a team to create a living colony, which they lead for a couple of years,
being paid off at the end of their contract.

Anyway, the colony prep team has been in position for about 11 months, and everything was going fine until
two months ago, when a series of accidents began. At first. these affected equipment, which was either
damaged or disappeared without trace, but then the same thing began to happen to people. They got worried
and called for help. The CSD sent investigators, who have succeeded only in stirring things up. Publicly, the
CSD say that the colonists have brought it all upon themselves (not that they have made it clear how or why
they have done so!). Privately, they concede that there is a possibility that they have been interfered with
from outside by “non-normal means” - whatever that’s supposed to mean! When he realised this, the CSD
Commander, safely on their jump ship the Lone Star, recalled the investigators. They got into their shuttle
and prepared to leave. The shuttle took off, but the last radio message received from it was from a sub-orbital
position, still in atmosphere.

The message ran “Lone Star shuttle Aeres outbound from Grant Base, ETA...” at which point it faded out.
Then the Lone Star received “My God, what is that?”, a scream and finally “The light! The light!” The
transmission cut out abruptly, no fading or anything, and at that moment the shuttle disappeared from the
Lone Star’s sensors. Since then, they have not been able to discover any wreckage or life signs. It is very
unusual for shuttles to crash (although I was on one which did, back on X243) as they are so stable that they
can just about fly themselves - unlike dropships which have all the aerodynamic capability of the average
rock!

On the planet, there are five out of the ten colony prep team remaining, two are dead and three are missing.
Arne Holtzmann, the team leader, is still alive, refusing to leave, and claims that the CSD is trying to stitch
them up. The UW have meanwhile put the colonists on hold, whilst we lot are sent in to find out what’s
happening. Not that we have much information to go on. Before they left, the Lone Star scanned the whole
planet and found no traces of life - or of the transponders all personnel were wearing - apart from the five
surviving members of the prep team. No unexpected power sources or vehicles were found. There’s not
much about the planet that sounds threatening either, it has no large carnivores and no signs of sentient life
have been found anywhere. The only unusual thing that has been noticed are a few transient magnetic
anomalies, but nobody’s followed them up in detail, although they are thought to be atmospheric in nature.

Our mission is firstly to find out who is lying and who is telling the truth, checking out all the people
involved and their stories, and secondly to investigate the area, looking for people, debris and so on. We were
warned that the colony prep team are likely to be less than helpful since the CSD investigators have been
blundering around, especially as they’d decided that the prep team had set the whole thing up so that they
could get off the planet. So they are annoyed and (certainly if something weird has been happening) probably
scared as well.

The briefing ended with the announcement that we would go down in a drop ship at 0900 the next morning,
local time, and make a tactical sweep into Grant’s Base, the settlement from the drop site. We are expected, if
not welcomed. The Garavaglia is at present in geostationary orbit above the base, once the drop ship has
returned she’s going to start doing a “ball of string” orbital pattern, doing a double sensor sweep of the whole
planet. This should take about 14 hours, and of course some of the time we will be out of communication
with her.

With a busy day ahead, we soon were heading for our bunks. I was cornered by Sergeant Turner, who had a
couple of the IRAG computers with him and wanted to show me the new messaging facility he’d written.
Pity it doesn’t quite go yet, but the concept is apparent... although why his test message was addressed to
“Mexie-babes” I am not absolutely sure!

Up bright and early the next morning, we were soon organised into squads. I ended up in Alpha Squad,
commanded by Captain Zwalf, along with Sergeant Turner (2 i/c), Reed, Bean, Zeus, Lana and Martins.
Svjenson then appeared and said that the dropship was prepped and ready to go. We would be dropped
maybe half a klick ftom Grant’s Base and would perform a preliminary sweep from there on in. And have
breakfast once we arrived. He also said that the Garavaglia had scanned the area again, finding no life signs
or transponder signals apart from the five surviving colonists, and had successfully dropped and recovered
an atmosphere probe, which had found nothing out of the ordinary. Once we’d been dumped the dropship
was to return, and the Garavaglia would get on with the ball of string scans, but a second dropship would
remain on standby, able to bring down a heavy weapons team if we really needed the backup.

So, down we went. A great relief when the doors opened and we all hurried out and into an all-round
defence. The dropship took off again almost immediately, and we formed up and moved out. There was a
clear track from the drop zone to Grant’s Base, and it didn’t take us long to get there. Only one odd thing, on
the way we encountered a strange mist or fog, white and quite think. The sun was already well up, and there
wasn’t any other fog. Not being much of a meteorologist, I can’t say for certain, but it didn’t seem like the
sort of place that mist would linger. No smell or taste, and we passed through it without any ill-effects. Pity
nobody thought to take samples.

At Grant’s Base there were several long, low buildings, including the barracks block that was to be our base.
A note on the door read “Marines. Out. Enjoy breakfast. See you later. K. Regan”. So in we went, and
Sergeant Dag Jones soon had breakfast organised. A few people wanted screens or weapons checking, which
I dealt with, then I did a spell of guard duty outside. Before too long, Fluffy Bunny was getting us all
organised, patrols for the other two squads while the whole of Alpha was set to basic training. Zwalf said that
it would be unfair to teach Reed on his own, and anyway the rest of us could probably use it!

SO we Sat in the base and listened to him talking about weapons handling, squad organisation and such like.
Then out and round the back to practice fieldcraft. Moving silently, using cover... and I ended up
demonstrating crawls. Suddenly this entertainment was disturbed by two loud explosions. By the time we’d
jumped up and scurried round to the front of the building, everybody else had gone off to investigate. Zwalf
sent Turner and me to check out the barracks. Inside, there were five people sitting around one of the tables
discussing irrigation pumps and a pipeline that had gone down. Otherwise the place was empty. Others soon
returned, and Fluffy Bunny called for me to issue a screen to one of the colonists, who had offered to guide a
patrol to a likely crash site for the missing shuttle. He wasn’t too impressed when I put him down as the
authorisation for an equipment issue to non-Marine personnel! That done, the patrol, led by Lt. Calvin, left
and we got back to our training.

Eventually we came in for a break and a brew, and found that most of the others were around as well. Fluffy
Bunny called the inevitable briefing. Not much to be said, apart from those who’d investigated the two bangs
had come under fire from one or two individuals with heavy weapons. More interesting was what Calvin’s
patrol had to say. They’d seen a group of four people standing talking, all wearing MS-CMC screens - the
colony prep team had only gotten civilian screens, the one who’d acted as guide, to whom I’d issued a
military screen, had been required to return it after the patrol. Also, although they had not found any
wreckage they had found some odd white powdery residue, laid out in a circle, which they had taken samples
of. I was asked if I had anything to analyse it with, but neither I nor Mimiannapandawawa had any analysis
kit with us, so arrangements were made for it to be collected by dropship and taken up to the Garavaglia for
analysis. The colony prep team said that this powder - they’d never bothered to analyse it - appeared to be
associated with the various odd events that had befallen them, it had been seen just before the incidents had
taken place. The mist, they said, just appeared from time to time, no rhyme or reason about it.

By now it was raining heavily. This upset the prep team, who were moaning because they’d just spent the
morning working on the irrigation system and now the planet was irrigating itself quite happily! Zwalf
wasn't too happy either, he’d wanted to practise field formations - extended lines and staggered files and the
like - with us. The remainder of the morning dragged on, and at last it was time for lunch.

While we were eating lunch, Fluffy Bunny came in and apologised for the timing of his announcement, but
he had had the results of the analysis back from the Garavaglia. The white powder had proven to be made of
a mixture of polymers, plastics and animal proteins, and looked very much as if they were the remains of the
shuttle and its passengers, just about reduced to their component molecules. A thought struck me, and I
asked if any measurements of the magnetic state had been made. Fluffy Bunny looked at me rather hard.
“Funny you should ask that, Mexal” he said, “They had a very high magnetic resonance.” There was more
news on that front too, the Garavaglia had detected two fluctuations, these magnetic anomalies that have
been reported, and - apparently coupled with them (or at least occurring at the same time) - odd life signs
which were different before and after the anomaly. And all this within 100 km of the base.

Lunch over, Zwalf decided to take Alpha Squad out on patrol, saying that we could practice formations as
well as having a look around. Well, we had a good time, even exchanging fire with a few hostiles, who ran
off before we could get a look at them. However, we did manage to find some odd items, which I picked up
and brought in. Looked like parts of a printed circuit board, and when I had time to sit down and have a good
look at them, they appeared to be three parts of a single board, broken across with a little bit chipped off
altogether. As far as I could tell, it was some kind of cybernetic control equipment, although I could not tell
its precise function. In fact, I couldn’t even recognise some of the components, and the whole thing was
unfamiliar technology.

Fluffy Bunny decided to send everybody out on patrol, just leaving a few people in the base. Zwalf called me
back to join the rest of the squad, but we were having quite a lot of trouble with the screens - some had
gotten soaked and others were in need of a service - so I asked to be excused and settled down in a corner to
sort them out. The ones I could fix I did, and the rest were marked and bagged up ready to be dealt with back
on the Garavaglia after the mission was over. While I was doing this, one of the other squads brought in a
body that they had found, which was frozen solid. Nobody we knew, not even one of the missing people.
There was also a briefcase with him, with a load of notes and papers in it. Fluffy Bunny wandered off,
looking at the papers, and I went back to armouring.

No peace... I was disturbed by Mimiannapandawawa calling for me. So I scuttled round to her medical
cubby-hole, which was next to my armourer’s one, to see what she wanted doing for her. Turned out that she
wanted to give me a medical, got me to sit down and asked a whole raft of questions - I’m sure they’ve been
asked about 53 times before. She’d never heard of CoedArian, and I don’t think she has any knowledge of
the CoedArianese and our differences from humans. I tried to explain as much as I could, but it would be
appreciated if Doctor Batigh could drop her a line. She also carried out one or two tests - took some blood,
measured something she called “NVR” which I think is something to do with the amount of hard radiation
on your home world and examined my eyes with some device with a very strong point light source that left
me dazzled for ages. She apologised when I explained how light-sensitive we are... that was something I’d
forgotten to say. Eventually she let me go, and I returned to my screens. It was important to keep them
going... if it came to real trouble the barracks didn’t have a building screen so we would have to rely on our
personal ones even indoors.

Next thing to happen was the return of Alpha Squad, carrying two of their number. Something about they’d
been overrun by aggressors, called for reinforcements from the rest of the company, and finally made it out,
but with two people still in need of medical attention. Glad I’d stayed back in base, for once, although I was
getting rather twitchy at being cooped up inside for so long. Worse, two others - Rikki Tikki Tavi and a bloke
called Wellesley - were missing. Meanwhile, at some point someone who had seen that group of four
Strangers wearing MS-CMC screens realised that one of them was a member of the colony prep team, fellow
called Bryant. Fluffy Bunny decided to haul him in for questioning.

When the arresting party got back with him, he proved most uncooperative. He wouldn’t say who the people
he’d been talking to were, although he didn’t deny it, just said that he just gave them food. That upset the rest
of the prep team, who were listening to the proceedings - one of the females looked as though she was about
to strangle them, and had to be hauled off. The leader, Holtzmann, was saying something about “Just give
him to us”, but Fluffy Bunny wasn’t interested, just continued his questioning.

Eventually it came out that the strangers were Hengists, members of one of those weird groups who believe
that aliens will be the salvation of the humans. Their calculations (based on what, nobody knows!) have
suggested that the aliens are coming imminently and will be arriving here on Grant’s World. So - which is
odd seeing as the Hengists are for some reason convinced that the aliens will be friendly to humans - they set
about a string of nuisance attacks to get the colonists to leave before the aliens got here. However, he denied
vehemently that they’d had anything to do with any deaths, of the prep team or the CSD investigators. In
fact, these deaths and disappearances have them baffled too. Anyway, Fluffy Bunny then expressed himself
of the opinion that the Hengists were the problem and we’d have to deal with them, and ordered Bryant
locked up. As he was led off, the same female who’d had a go before made a second attempt to attack him,
screaming and yelling. I was standing behind her, half expecting this, and pounced.... we ended up in an
undignified heap on the floor. Holtzmann eventually managed to calm her down.

After this excitement, Fluffy Bunny resorted to his usual tactic, a full debrief of events to date. He was of the
opinion that the nuisance attacks at least were caused by the Hengists, although it seems possible that there
may actually be two groups, one content with monkeywrenching and the other prepared to become more
violent. The mist and the electromagnetic disturbances he is dismissing as irrelevant, I’m not so sure about
that. Anyway, we had a run-through of events so far - our arrival, breakfast, then (while we were round the
back doing fieldcraft training) the colony prep team had arrived. Then there were two explosions, and those
who investigated encountered two contacts, who fired on them then left - very mysterious, they appeared to
vanish without trace. Various garbled accounts of how they’d gone behind bushes or over walls or
something, but when followed there was no trace of them. Then a patrol had gone to the possible crash site,
and seen those people, one of whom had been Bryant - both Chaos and S.C. Ratch had identified him latet....
that was the first time they’d seen him, they then realised who he was when they met up with the colonists
later.

Then came an interesting but I hadn’t heard before. An android - at least. that’s what they think it is - has
been spotted. From the description, it sounds like one I remember seeing back in June 2493 on the planet
where we found the groundnuts... all in black, no discernible face, some kind of sensor on a chest panel,
moves very fast and does not behave aggressively, just observes. I recall hearing at the time some rumours
about it was believed to belong to something called the Jester Corporation, who think cloning and genetic
enhancements are unethical, and that robots should be used instead. But nobody really knows who or what it
is. It had first been spotted just after an explosion, which had been preceded by some kind of high-pitched
whistling sound. Later, it was seen near where those bits of circuit board were found, apparently pulling
something out of its chest panel and dropping it... very possibly the board, which may have been damaged
and in need of replacement. The first time it was seen it was limping, the next time it was moving smoothly
at speed, which does tend to suggest that it had repaired itself. Well, I’d certainly like a closer look at it! The
second time it had been seen, it had ended up by going behind a bush, then there had been a sound like an
incoming artillery shell, a bang and when people raised their heads again it had gone.

Then two further patrols had been sent out (this whilst I was busy with armourer’s duties) and had found the
frozen body, which they had been led to by a human dressed all in black, who had then left. A briefcase had
been found with the body, containing a sheaf of papers about the exploration of a planet called XB242... the
funny thing is that the names of the party corresponded with the original archological group sent to X244.
Fluffy Bunny asked me for them, once he’d noticed the similarity in planet names, then handed me the
papers and told me to have a look at them. I raised the question that perhaps they’d somehow been
transported here - even though it’s on the far side of the galaxy - through their tampering with whatever
they’d found on X244.

That was just about the end of the briefing, just some more patrolling, when Alpha Squad were attacked, as
were the people sent in after them. On their return, Jarvis had been arrested and questioned, and that brought
us up to date.

I then settled down to read the papers I’d been handed. The notes appeared to be the hand-written log of
“Team RB561A” written by a Dr. Leo Permis on the planet XB242. The first part was a day by day account
of how they’d set up a base, and then moved it to another site where one of them had found a high
concentration of steel. Nobody was enjoying good health, and the one who’d found the steel had eventually
gone mad and smashed all their comms equipment. There was a full analysis of the planet’s atmosphere -
decidedly different from Grant’s World, although it could be breathed for limited periods of time without too
many adverse effects - and various other bits of data, also a graph showing peaks and troughs but without
any labels on the axes.... scruffy science in the extreme! The final part was biographical details of the team
members, nothing very interesting there, the usual range of academic types, although one or two had a
service background and several had only recently joined the team before it was sent out. Looked like they’d
probably all ended up dead.

My reading was disturbed by the arrival, under escort from the door guards, of a familiar face - Farqua, who
we'd last seen on K685. Several people had recognised him, but nobody had remembered his name until I
looked up from my papers and said “Good evening, Mr. Farqua”. He sat down and chattered away in his
usual annoying and elliptical way, making like he was telling us a lot - interspersed with insults of course -
whilst saying very little indeed. Every time he said something rude about the Marines, and that was frequent,
Fluffy Bunny reminded him how far he was from the door.

Anyway, Farqua said that he’d come to trade pleasantries and to offer us a free ticket off planet - meaning, I
think, that should we go now we'd be allowed to leave without harassment. Apparently he’s working with, or
for, the Hengists, who have some kind of business venture making Grant’s World acceptable to the aliens.
The Hengists tend to get over-protective about the things they want, that’s why they keep attacking us. As
well as the Hengists, there is a fellow dressed in black called The Soldier and the android, whom he referred
to as The Jester. Farqua had one of our maps, which Chaos admitted to having lost (or perhaps had removed
wile he was unconscious), but said that he only knew about one Marine being held prisoner. For all his
bluster, I don’t think he knows the whole of what is going on either.

When he’d finished his spiel, he was allowed to leave, saying that he’d be back. Fluffy Bunny called me over
and passed me Farqua’s sidearm, which must have been taken from him when he entered the base, telling me
to accompany him for at least 200 metres before returning it to him. So off I went. I don’t think he was too
happy having to walk off into the darkness with me beside him, he quite obviously doesn’t like me although
whether that’s because I’m an elf or because of my memory I’m not sure. I think some others were following
along behind.

At the designated distance, I handed him his weapon, and he headed off, saying “Tell Harris I’ll be back
soon”. I stayed watching him as he went off along the track in the direction of the place our drop ship had
landed. He veered off to the left, then went back across the path. At this moment a loud whistling sound was
heard, followed by a bright red flash and a loud bang. I started running, and could hear others behind me. I
think someone was shouting “Come back, Mexal”, but then they backed me up as I went forwards to
investigate. Couldn’t find anything much, no signs of Farqua.... just a 2 metre diameter circle of flattened
grass and some more of that white dust. I wanted to have a more detailed scout around, but we were recalled.
Back at base, I suggested that a sample of the dust might be a good idea, and was sent out to get it.
Subsequent analysis suggested that poor Farqua had indeed been resolved to his component molecules.

After that, I took a turn of guard duty, carefully avoiding the Recruit’s Test which the rest of Alpha Squad
were required to take! I’d been stuck inside, working on armourer’s duties, far too long and was glad of an
opportunity to sit outside in the fresh air. Worst part of being a Marine is being cooped up inside spacecraft,
base buildings and the like. Eventually, I was relieved, and only just in time to get my supper.

Once the meal was over, Fluffy Bunny ordered Bryant brought out from wherever he’d been locked up, and
said that, despite his objections, he’d been ordered by Svjenson to release him forthwith. The colony prep
team people were hanging around making aggressive noises, and Fluffy Bunny tried to persuade Bryant to
accept protective custody, but he refused. Then Holtzmann pulled a handgun and stood waiting,
threateningly. Despite the fact that he’s at least a head and a half taller than I, and outweighs me, I managed
to relieve him of the weapon - just placed my hand over his and repeated “Give it to me” until he let go. Then
scuttled off, fast.

Once Bryant had gone, Fluffy Bunny apologised to Holtzmann, and explained that releasing Bryant had been
a deliberate ploy, he was being followed in the hopes that he’d lead us to the Hengists. Holtzmann accepted
this, and said that as far as he was concerned the Marines could have a free hand to sort matters out, but that
he was not prepared to leave the planet whilst we did so.

And so, off on patrol in force. I was back with Alpha Squad now, and glad to be back out again. We went off
through woodland and along tracks, and eventually found some people, who opened fire on us. A fairly
confused fight, around some building with a large antenna on top in the middle of a wood, ensued, this
ending with all aggressors either dead or run away, apart from one prisoner, who we took back to the base.
Fluffy Bunny settled down to question him, telling me to stay close and listen. However, he didn’t have very
much to say. He admitted freely to being a Hengist, and moaned that most of his men had been killed -
although he was blaming us, it soon became apparent that someone (or someTHING?) else is at least in part
responsible. He owned up to the monkeywrenching activities, but not to causing any deaths or
disappearances. Eventually, Fluffy Bunny managed to cut a deal with him, that he would be released in
return from pinpointing the Hengists’ base. Before letting him go, Fluffy Bunny called for an armourer -
Martins barged forwards before I had time to move, and the pair of them went off. Later Martins told me that
he’d fixed the Hengist’s weapon so that it had a reduced rate of fire!

Plans were laid for a multi-pronged assault on the Hengist camp, with the other two squads coming at it from
two directions with us of Alpha in reserve coming directly from the direction of our base and able to swing
in any direction as appropriate. We were also to spring any ambushes that they might have waiting for us.
The overall mission objectives were firstly to terminate the Hengists with extreme prejudice (Fluffy Bunny
loves that term, I think it dates from early Earth history, somewhere about the Elizabethan age) and secondly
to get our missing Marines back. Just before we set out, news came in that the Garavaglia has broadcast an
interdiction on Grant’s World until this matter is sorted out.

This is when it all got a bit confusing. I was “tail-end Charlie” of the squad, and followed along, keeping an
eye out behind, as we wandered for what seems ages over a variety of terrains, scrub, woodland and what I
reckon must have been some of the agronomists’ experimental plots, judging by the fertiliser! Eventually,
sneaking along the edge of a wood, we were attacked by several people armed with heavy weapons... who
appeared as surprised to see us as we were to encounter them. I hit the deck, then made the mistake of
moving when I was told to shift position to the edge of the wood where the others were.... why is it that
every time I do as I’m told I get shot? Someone had me in their sights, with the inevitable result!

I regained consciousness somewhere in the middle of woodland - must have been moved whilst unconscious
- being held down as the effects of cyclazine took their course. I was beginning to think that maybe the
medics are right about the long-term effects of IR exposure, I was still disorientated and rather nauseous
even after they’d let me go, then suddenly I was pushed back onto the ground, someone lying across my legs,
as someone else - I think it was S.C. Ratch - administered another drug.... and I felt the unmistakable effects
of more cyclazine. Dazed and disorientated, screaming, I heard something about “She’s having a bad
reaction, keep an eye on her”, followed by the order to move out. I was half-carried, half-dragged off, and I
don’t think my head really cleared until we were somewhere just outside our base building.

Someone was saying something about there being a suspicious object in the building, then Fluffy Bunny
came up calling for someone to go down. Cardinal was already inside, but needed backup. I went forward,
Fluffy Bunny was saying something about not me, wanting to keep at least one of the techs outside, but I
didn’t pay much attention... EOD specialists are few and far between but when you need them you really do.

I settled down in the doorway, listening to Cardinal’s running commentary on what he’d found, the pair of us
slotting into the standard procedure.

“Detonator, two wires - blue.” Cardinal said. “Some kind of device to hold it closed. Red wire floating,
looped across a PCB. Some kind of plastic housing, male and female connectors... 3 or 4 wires across....
There’s a piece of paper - no writing on it, moving that out of the way - there’s a count-down timer going.” I
made a quick sketch from his description, then he said that he was going to turn the room lights on - he’d
been working by torchlight so far. Once he’d done so, with no ill effects I’m glad to say, he reported that the
device appeared to be a modified version of a standard CMC area effect device, with timer and anti-tamper
device. As there was plenty of time on the clock, it was decided to move it - extremely carefully - about 300
metres away (the blast radius is about 200 metres) and deal with it in the morning. I was chased away at this
point, leaving Cardinal and someone else (not sure who) to carry the device off.

Soon thereafter, we were all inside. I couldn’t settle, despite the long and busy day. There just seemed to be
too many things to do, but I found it very difficult to concentrate on any of them. Martins wanted a screen
attended to, someone else wanted a replacement power cell, everybody was clustered around the urn, I
wanted a drink but couldn’t be bothered to hang around waiting, then Ruby Axe came up asking something
or other, I said I'd talk to her later.... then found that she’d manhandled me into a chair and was refusing to let
me get up, shouting for the Surgeon Commander. Said worthy arrived, and started asking me what had
happened out in the field. I said something about having been shot and given cyclazine, and that I had too
much to do to sit chatting right now. She kept telling me to calm down, to take things easy, relax, and
eventually explained that as far as she could tell I had been given too much cyclazine! Then she explained
that I would be hyperactive for the rest of the night, but that the effects would wear off during the following
day. Great! I hate the stuff, have only once gotten through a mission without it (Juliette, last December) and
now they overdose me! She want off, and I overheard her telling people to keep an eye on me.

Well, I was pretty restless all night, and still quite twitchy in the morning, found it difficult to stay still.
Meanwhile, breakfast was served followed by the inevitable debrief. Calvin and his squad had apparently
crawled around a lot but found little, moreover they hadn’t followed orders but had wandered off somewhere
else. We, being supposed to spring any ambushes, had in fact moved so quietly that we’d almost stood upon
the waiting aggressors before they’d noticed our presence. It also appears that at one point the aggressors
opened fire on each other! Overall, the mission was not exactly a success, but not a complete failure either.
But either the Hengist was lying or they had moved their base camp.

Then Fluffy Bunny called together the “bang gang” - primarily Cardinal and myself, Waylander was hanging
around and Martins came up claiming he knew EOD (he doesn’t, although he’s good at setting APDs!).
Cardinal and I decided to place a small handling charge on top of the device, the idea being to destroy the
timer/detonator... and as this was to be done outside and with everybody at a safe distance if the whole thing
went up, it would not really matter. While the rest of the Marines set up a defensive perimeter, Cardinal and I
went to check out the device. First time I’d had a good look at it, about a metre high plastic drum with the
timer/detonator system on the top. Then we came under fire from several aggressors, wielding heavy
weapons. My screen took quite a few hits, but - still feeling the aftereffects of last night’s overdose of
cyclazine - I didn’t really feel them. The others chased them off eventually, and we set up the handling
charge, angled so that its blast would hit the detonator sideways, then Cardinal pressed its detonation switch
and we scarpered, taking cover where we had a good view of the results.

Just before the delay on the handling charge’s detonation system expired, a small human male came hurtling
past the device, not quite succeeding in reaching cover before the handling charge went off, followed by a
second small explosion. He lurched, then continued in his headlong rush, with most of the Marines in hot
pursuit. Cardinal went off too, shouting to me to go and check the results of the explosion. I approached
cautiously, and found that our controlled demolition had worked well, the handling charge had knocked the
detonator off the top of the drum, and although it too had then gone off, it was by then separated from the
main device. To my surprise, when I looked into the big drum, I found that there was hardly any explosives
in there - the thing was well-nigh a dummy!

Once I was happy that all danger was past, I went back inside and found that the fellow who had run past just
before the explosion was being treated for a concussion. He came round, and promptly hid in a corner behind
some mattresses, apparently too scared to come out. He was unscreened, and someone shouted to me to get
him a screen, and I eventually managed to talk him out of hiding, put the screen on his head and get him
settled down on a chair. He was still very nervous and twitchy, and I crouched beside him with an arm
around his shoulders while Fluffy Bunny tried to question him.

It was all very confused, but it seems that he was one of the colony prep team people that had disappeared.
He knew the Hengists, said that they liked him, and also said that he’d been living in “the box with the twig
on top”. Then he began to babble about the “men with stars in their eyes” and the “big pink” and a circle
which if you ran through it summoned the big pink, then the men with stars in their eyes would come and
talk to you. This all seemed to be somewhere near where Farqua had disappeared. He drew a sketch of all
this in my notebook... then said that it was secret and tried to tear the page out. This conversation wandered
in circles for a while, with a few additional references to a “fluffy fog” and the secret thing that the men with
Stars in their eyes were after, which he claimed to have, but his hands were empty. Quite mad, poor soul, but
with enough referents to make us wonder just what had caused him to flip.

The madman’s drawing.

Anyway, Fluffy Bunny soon ordered us all out again, to go up to the place this fellow appeared to be talking
about. Somehow I ended up at the back, and by the time I got there everybody else was setting up an
all-round defence. They’d apparently caught someone, because suddenly everybody rushed off again -
something about we had a bare five minutes to get someplace else, which was where the two captured
Marines were, before some terrible event took place. Naturally, everyone took off as fast as they could go....
and left me well behind. It can be a disadvantage, coming from a low-gravity world!

I arrived just in time to see a wide circle marked out, everybody around it at a cautious distance. The two
Marines were lying in the middle, probably unconscious. Somebody rushed through, grabbed one of them,
then Zwalf charged in, there was a loud high-pitched whistle, a bright flash, loud bang and a cloud of smoke.
When that had cleared there was nothing except some of that white powdery residue. Shocked, we all made
our way back to base. There was no sign of Zwalf or Wellesley anywhere, but Rikki Tikki Tavi had been
retrieved, muttering something about “Just wait until my family hears about this!”. Once inside, I suggested
that it would be a good idea to collect some of the white powder, it might give us some clue as to the missing
men’s fate... if the worst had happened, the CMC maintains copious records and a match of DNA samples
could well be possible. Fluffy Bunny agreed, and gave me three men as escort whilst I went out to collect
samples.

By the time I got back with my samples, everybody else had packed up and we moved out to meet the drop
ship, and were returned to the Garavaglia swiftly. Once there, I wasted no time in getting my samples
analysed, and was relieved to discover no traces of anything that could possibly be Marine! So, whatever’s
happened to them, they have not been broken down into their components and spread over Grant’s World.

So, what has been going on? Nobody knows. My guess is that someone - possibly aliens, but just as likely
not - has discovered how to make a matter transporter work. The Hengists are gullible enough to make
suitable tools to sow confusion, scurrying around claiming that aliens are coming and attempting to get rid of |

colonists, CSD inquiry teams and so on. The disappearances might have been deliberate, or they could have
been early experiments that went wrong. Same for the shuttle disappearance, either they intended to destroy
it - for example by turning the system off mid-transport! - or they attempted to transport it but it was just too
large for the system to cope with. The flashes, whistles, mists and the white powder are side-effects. A
transporter could explain at least in part that frozen body... at least how it got here. Maybe whoever is
responsible for the “Jester” android is also behind all this. We'll see, one of these odd days (maybe).

All my respects,

Mexal
