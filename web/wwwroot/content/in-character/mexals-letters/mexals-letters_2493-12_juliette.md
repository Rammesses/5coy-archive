The Reverend Elder Belzakath
High Forest Hall,
Coed'Arian.

September 15, 2493.

To Marine Mexal,
Greetings.

It was good to receive your letter covering your latest mission with the Marines. Everyone here is most
pleased that you are prospering. However, it is maybe time that you considered applying for a commission -
you have proved your worth, and as you held rank here when in the White Guards Regiment it is perhaps
time..... But of course that is up to you.

I have instigated an investigation as to how this Krystal Spyers could have obtained a copy of your
letter concerning your visit to Kruger. The encryption we agreed before you left should have been sufficient,
and I am sure that you are not foolish enough to pass copies of your letters around.

The account of advanced training was entertaining - General Tassach has indicated that he will be
passing it on to the Officer Candidate School. For that matter, if you decide to return to CoedArian think he
has an instructor’s posting awaiting you.

It seems that this Brotherhood is no localised phenomenon. The UWI representative has been less than
helpful on the matter, so anything else you can discover about them will be of the greatest interest. I wonder
if they have any connection with Purity, given your comments about threats made to your ears. Or maybe
they have little acquaintance with those of us who have pointed ones, and like many folk, fear or hate that
which they do not know. Still, it seems that you Marines did a good job in dealing with their threat.

On the whole, it is the opinion of the Elders that the experiment of sending selected CoedArianese to
join United Worlds organisations is proving a success. It is a matter of personal pride that you appear to be
one of the best of our emissaries. Keep it up!

My blessings rest upon you,

To: The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From: Marine Mexal, on board the Caravaglia, in orbit, Juliette.
Date: 05-12-2494.

Greetings!

It seems a long time since I have had anything much to write about. Since the visit to X243, they have been
keeping us in a quarantine facility somewhere - they weren’t letting on where. Even when, at your request,
they allowed me to return to CoedArian for your Consecration, I was sent firstly to CMC HQ and thence
home, and required to return the same way! I was glad for the trip, it’s been a pretty boring few months!
Especially as they were being evasive about why we were being held. We were rarely able to communicate
with each other, let alone the outside world! For once, even Interstella seems to know more about what is
going on than we do.

Still, all such things come to an end. Most of the Marines were given leave, but as I’d had the trip home, I
was seconded to CMC Public Relations Division and given the task of writing some recruiting literature
from a “"Marine’s eye view." Eventually the others came back - some had gone home, others had fitted in a
trip to Sol - and we were told to prepare for a return to active duty, to get ready to ship out on the Caravaglia,
back to CMC HQ. We were warned to make sure that we had dress kit, as the Regimental Dinner was to be
held en route. You can imagine how happy we all were to be reunited with each other - hugs and kisses all
round. Preparations were well in hand for the dinner when the alarm for a drop out of Jump sounded, and we
were all called into the briefing room by RSM Honer.

Once settled, Colonel Svjenson and Lieutenant Calvin arrived. Svjenson told us that we had come out of
Jump near a planet called Juliette, where they had a task for us. Juliette is not a member of the United
Worlds, although diplomatic overtures have been being made for the past couple of years to persuade them to
join. Apart from the normal “United Worlds is fantastic, everyone should join" attitude of the UW
government, they want to use Juliette as a staging post for exploratory missions in this sector. Not much is
known about the planet, as they are dismissive if not openly hostile to the UW, and very territorial, not
welcoming any visitors whatsoever. They have extensive military forces, including a well-equipped if
somewhat old-fashioned Space Navy and large numbers of ground troops, also a standing police force. The
presence of secret police is suspected, but - at the time of the briefing - not confirmed. The government is a
dictatorship, so secret police are a distinct possibility!

Anyway, as well as diplomatic missions, the planet has been under observation during these past two years.
They’d begun with overflights, and then begun a programme of covert landings, inserting
intelligence-gathering units. The area which we are to be dropped in has already been visited by two drones,
followed up by a manned mission. However, when the time came for this party to leave, their dropship had
failed to make orbit and subsequently crashed. It is believed that there was at least one survivor, as the signal
from a SARBe has been detected. There was a four-man crew, one of whom was our own Captain Zwalf.

The others were a second pilot, a UW representative (I guess that’s a euphemism for "spy"!) and a civilian
agronomist - this is an agricultural region.

The Juliette Government is aware that something has crashed there - everyone’s hoping that they haven't
realised what - and is moving units of the army into the area to search. The local population believe that a
meteorite landed in the valley in question - nobody said whether they’d been deliberately misled by their
government or have come up with this idea independently. The UW believes that should they find evidence
of covert UW or CMC presence on their planet, the consequences are liable to be very serious - not just a
cessation of negotiation, it’s entirely possible that they might declare war!

Our task is to locate the wreckage and ensure that the flight recorder is recovered, and any other evidence as
to whose dropship it was is either collected or destroyed. We, of course, are to operate covertly. Only
sidearms are to be used, and all evidence as to who we are was to be left on the Caravaglia... even dogtags
and IDs. This caused an immediate strip-act by Fugazi, who was wearing a new unit T-shirt he’d recently
designed and distributed amongst us. Poor Svjenson looked a bit startled at that!

Then came the bombshell. If contact is unavoidable, and our cover is broken, we were given orders to
terminate with extreme prejudice. Svjenson was none too happy to issue this order, he’d argued against it
right up to the highest levels but the Supreme Commander himself had insisted, on the grounds that
revelation of our presence could lead to a war. Lesser of two evils, perhaps, but Fugazi voiced all of our
thoughts when he stood up and said that while he was prepared to follow legal orders, he was not at all happy
about the thought of having to kill possibly unarmed civilians in cold blood just because they’d been
unfortunate enough to notice us. Svjenson merely reiterated the orders, but to do him justice I don’t think he
was any too happy with them either.

The plan was to drop us in three groups, which would gather and proceed to a location where we were to be
met by a local sympathiser, a businessman called Marmaduke. He would take us to a safe house, and we
would begin the search in the morning - by the time the drops could be completed it would be nearing local
midnight and the weather was not good. Once down, we’d be on our own, no heavy support or anything. The
Caravaglia’s presence was already upsetting the Juliette Government, and the drones we’d put out were
being shadowed by elements of their Space Navy. We were going to have to move fast, extraction was
scheduled for 1615 local time the next day, planned to coincide with one of the gaps in their radar - as their
kit is old they tend to close down the approach radars periodically and so undetected drops are possible if
timed right.

As we are not supposed to be there at all, and certainly not as the Colonial Marine Corps, I suggested that we
go down in civilian dress. Svjenson responded that it was a close-kit rural community who would notice
Strangers, but that as the planet is heavily militarised, and with a culture that represses curiosity, we would go
in unbadged uniform and claim to be Juliette’s "3rd Army", known to be stationed on a different continent,
Saying that we’d been drafted in to look for the "meteorite".

The briefing wound up then, ending with the information that, should we manage to find the remains of the
dropship, it has an internal demolition charge, and that the flight recorder should be within 200 metres of the
crash site. Requests for information as to what it looked like didn’t get very far - one of Svjenson’s staff was
sent off to find either technical specifications or a spare one for us to look at, but this never materialised. The
final point made was that should all go wrong and our cover be blown, the UW politicians will deny
everything!

Lieutenant Calvin was to be in command, Svjenson was remaining on the Caravaglia - probably trying to
explain to the Juliette government how the ship’s presence was entirely innocent! The three squads were
soon sorted out, Calvin would lead one, with O’Shaunessy, Blackthorne (still wearing that security control
collar!), Schwartzkopf and a new addition, Riccottanini. Sergeant Apone was given Casselle, Zeus ("Marine
Trouble"), Turner and Ruby Axe; and I was in Sergeant Martin’s mob, along with Chaos, Fugazi and S.C.
Ratch. You’ve heard of most of these before, although Joel Turner has been on secondment to a group
developing combat computer systems and hasn’t been with us for a while. Gina Riccottanini is from Sol, and
claims to trace her family history back to some mediaeval (is that about 2000 years ago?) bunch called
Mafia, who were somewhere between feudal rulers and crimelords. She gets a bit annoyed if you ask her
about it, or if you get her name wrong. Most people are calling her after various Italian regional foods, which
sound a bit similar, but I’ve settled for "Rikki Tikki Tavi". She tried to threaten me, but did not get very far
with her attempt to pick me up by the collar (being about the same height as me), so stood on a chair. That
made everybody else collapse with laughter, so she gave up in disgust!

Callsigns and challenges were soon arranged, we’d use "bullshit" (Rikki Tikki Tavi’s suggestion) as a
recognition sign, and - should the need arise - "Mario" to indicate the need to take out whoever we were
dealing with, if they showed signs of realising who we were.

All too soon, we were getting into the dropship. Hunter was flying as usual, and moaning about poor weather
conditions as we went in. She decided, or so she said, to be kind to us, and to drop us nearer to out RV than
she was supposed to - then asked us for some recompense for so doing! I promptly gave her a big kiss, but
she said "I meant something more tangible than that", so I offered her a mint! By the time the whole squad
had availed themselves of the offer, she’d had to leave.

It was dark, cold, damp, windy and miserable. We made our way along the road to what Martin said was the
RV point, a cross-roads, and settled down to watch all approaches. Various noises - including what sounded
horribly like someone using an RVC unit - could be heard, but nobody arrived. I could smell some kind of
animal, a sort of musky smell, but neither saw nor heard him. A predator, I guess, from the way it behaved.
Eventually, with some radio communication, Martin figured out that we were in the wrong place, and so we
moved south to another road junction, and finally found the others!

Soon thereafter, we were making our way towards where we were supposed to meet Marmaduke. By now I
was absolutely frozen and my vision was beginning to play tricks on me, kept seeing white flashes and
losing track of the people around me. Just as we reached the RV point, and could hear voices ahead, I
suddenly found several of the Marines clustered around me, asking if I was all right. I don’t remember much
more until we were in Marmaduke’s safe house, but it seems that the intense cold had gotten too much for
me. Later, the medics told me that it appears that we elves are less tolerant of low temperatures than humans,
and that I’d narrowly avoided hypothermia.

Anyway, once at the safe house, Calvin told me that when they’d arrived at the RV, they’d encountered four
people who said that they were Special Police. They’d taken Marmaduke prisoner, and tied him up. Calvin
had pretended to be an army commander, but hadn’t got very far, apparently the Special Police have
authority over everybody else, and can more or less do as they please without question. So the codeword
"Mario" had been given, and the police wiped out. Poor Marmaduke was untied, and led us to his safe house,
where we’d been able to get a hot drink before bedding down for the night.

Next morning, I had a chat with Marmaduke, who said that as far as he knew, the Special Police had been out
meteorite hunting, and had encountered him by chance. They suspect he’s up to something, but don’t know
what, so had decided to take him in for questioning. Fortunately, they had not had time to contact their base
before we had arrived, and they operate with a fair amount of latitude, so it is likely to be some time before
they are missed. He also said, when I asked him why he was helping us, that he was in favour of Juliette
joining the UW because of the profits he hopes to make as trade opens up. He also made some comment
about "We have mutants here, too", and when I looked puzzled he explained that he’d noticed my ears. He
went on to say that the locals called people with pointed ears “peggies", a reference to the belief that they got
that way by being pegged out on a washing line when young!

Then we had the inevitable debrief. So far so good. There had been a message from the Caravaglia, firstly
they’d now computed the trajectory of the crashed dropship, straight down the valley, over the lake - the
valley has been dammed and is used as a reservoir - quite near to the point where we met up with
Marmaduke. Secondly, a few reinforcements had been rustled up - three more members of 5 Company
who’d been otherwise engaged the night before. We of Martin’s mob were sent out to fetch them - to my
delight one of them was Dibley - and then all of us set off to search the lakeside. This was quite heavily
wooded - trees of the evergreen variety, with a thick carpet of fallen leaves but little undergrowth - and
relatively easy to move through. Most of the time, I was up at the far side of the wood from the lake, and saw
little more than trees and several specimens of a small animal, which had grey fur, large ears and a tendency
to scurry about. Looked like they might make good eating but there wasn’t time to catch one! It was pouring
with rain, and pretty miserable.

I heard later that some of the others found a farmer and his son, who knew nothing about the so-called
meteor, but when we got back to the safe house for lunch we surprised some intruders. Two were captured,
both human (I think that Juliette is predominantly populated by humans) a male and a female. We found a
small black box, maybe 10 cm by 15 cm by 5 cm, which was attached to a small parachute, which these
people had dropped in the doorway as they made their getaway. It was sealed, but had a key, a 25-way
connector and an unlit indicator light on one end. There was also a black briefcase which Martin, our sole
APD specialist, checked out as safe.

They were extremely reluctant to say anything, but eventually the female one said that they were scavengers,
who lived on what they could find. The male, who had proven extremely troublesome, said very little apart
from making complaints about being forced to talk to females and mutants (me). However, under somewhat
dubious methods of questioning, he did say that he and the female were divers, and had been hired to search
the lake bed, where they’d found some debris from the crashed dropship, including that black box and
various Other items (which they had put in the briefcase). They’d seen a few bodies, but were unsure how
many. The diving gear they’d been issued with was not very good, so they’d given up and wandered off to
see what else they could find in the area, and ended up at the safe house, wondering what the unusual activity
there was.

I don’t know what happened then. O’Shaunessy and I - who seemed to irritate him the most - were
continuing to question him, when a door crashed open and everything dissolved in a flare of intense pain.
Next thing I knew, Ruby Axe was fussing over me. Seems that some more of the scavengers had attacked the
safe house, firing IR weapons - and we were all unscreened! They’d recovered both their colleagues and
made off, but had, however, left the box and the briefcase behind. Fortunately, they’d not gone through the
entire building, and those unaffected by the initial assault had managed to rally sufficiently to drive them off
before dealing with those of us who were unconscious.

Calvin was understandably furious - although I guess he should have posted some guards! - and we were
soon ordered to set forth again. The female prisoner had pinpointed the crash site (I think they’d offered a
bribe to get her to talk), which turned out to be quite near to the place where we were due to be picked up by
the dropship, so Calvin decided that we’d leave, taking box and briefcase, and go to search that area
thoroughly before leaving - and hopefully catch up with the scavengers, although they were under the
impression that we were elements of Juliette’s army and so should not pose too great a risk.

We were soon ready to go. I was given the black box to carry, someone else - I think it was Turner - had the
briefcase. As we departed Calvin said "Last man out, turn on the gas and torch the place." Personally I would
have thought that such an action could only attract attention to our presence, but at least it meant that
anything we’d overlooked would not survive to endanger our mission.

We proceeded down a track towards the dam, and then down a path towards its foot. Some debris - looked
like the dropship’s main fuel tank - could be seen at the bottom, also some figures, guards in all probability.
However, as we came down a very steep and muddy track towards the open ground at the base of the dam,
we came under fire from about three people lurking along the hillside. Martin led us of his squad to deal with
them whilst the rest went down towards the valley floor. It didn’t take too long to deal with them, although
poor Martin was rendered unconscious by accumulated IR. I called for a medic, and Ruby came along to deal
with him.... he’s too big for me to shift!

By then, however, things had gone somewhat awry on the valley floor. It appears that Calvin had attempted
to talk to the people down there, but that they’d realised that all was not right and had managed to grab Zeus
and Casselle, who they were holding hostage. I’m not sure, but I think it may have been more of the
scavengers. Anyway, it looked like the only way would be to attack them, no matter the risk to the two
Marines. Then a human male came along and said that he was the "site warden". Calvin managed to
convince him that we were part of the Juliette army on manoeuvres, and that these people were interfering.
He tried talking to them but to no avail so he returned to where we were and said that if we were military,
surely we could deal with the matter ourselves, as we should have the authority to do so. Maybe he was
getting suspicious of us. Anyway, Calvin thought so... and killed him.

Zeus and Casselle appeared to be pleading with their captors in an attempt to buy time, and they were also
talking with us via radio. They then demanded the briefcase as the price for the two Marines’ lives.
Fortunately, we were far enough away for them not to notice Turner and I removing the contents. Most -
papers and some computer disks - went into Turner’s pockets, but there was one large piece of electronic
equipment, the flight status recorder unit, that was a bit large, so I pulled off the shemagh I was wearing and
wrapped it up. Then we advanced, me trying to look innocent with this bundle under my arm! Turner
meanwhile went forwards with the empty briefcase. The upshot of all this was that we managed to get close
enough to take out the aggressors and retrieve Zeus and Casselle, who were quite badly battered and barely
conscious even after the medics had done all that they could. We’d been told that anyone who couldn’t walk
was to be killed and left behind, but decided without hesitation that we’d carry them back regardless and
insist that they be taken up in the dropship with the rest of us.

Turner and I, meanwhile, had repacked the briefcase, then Calvin led a small group of us on a further search,
but we found nothing more. We began to make our way back towards the RV where the dropship was due to
come and collect us. About half way up the hillside track, we spotted some people - military uniforms this
time - coming towards us. They were leading someone with them, with his hands tied behind his back, and as
he got closer we saw that it was Captain Zwalf, looking rather dazed. Calvin accosted them, and asked them
what was going on. They said that they’d found this fellow wandering about and were going to take him in
for questioning, and began to moan about the paperwork involved, although one of them was muttering
about a possible bonus. Then they wanted to know what we were doing, and Calvin replied that we’d been
looking for the dropship and had found one or two bits but not much. That’s when he signalled the attack,
and two of the four troopers were dealt with in short order. Poor Zwalf was unconscious too, as he hadn’t
been wearing a screen, but he was soon revived. The other couple of men had made a bolt for it, and some of
the Marines went after them. The two bodies we had were carrying ID that said that they were the dam
guards.

Once Zwalf was on his feet, and the pursuit party had returned victorious, we got ready to continue up the
hill. Quite a few people were occupied with the wounded by now, and I ended up with both the black box
and the briefcase to carry. I scrambled up the hillside, by now we’d reached the steep and muddy bit,
fervently hoping that we would not be attacked again - I didn’t have a hand free to wield a weapon! Then
Zwalf came lurching along, not totally in command of himself - I think he had a concussion - and I was told
to keep an eye on him as well.

Then I heard a voice from above. A human female was looking down, shouting something about had we seen
her husband! I called back that we were engaged in a military operation and that this was a restricted area.
She replied that her husband was the site warden. I said that we hadn’t seen anybody, and she said that if we
did see him, could we say that she had her children in the car and that his mother was ill. I promised to pass
the message on, should we see him, and she went off. Meanwhile, I felt terrible - I think her husband was the
fellow Calvin had killed earlier!

Apart from that, we reached the RV without incident, and took cover around the area to await the dropship. It
seemed to take ages, and it was by now getting dark and very cold. Calvin and Martin kept checking up on
me, I think that they were worrying about elves in the cold again! Zwalf said something about having
dropped his jacket, with his ID in the pocket, before he was captured, and Blackthorne, with a few others,
were sent off to take a look. They came back having failed to find it - I just hope nobody else does!
Eventually three dropships arrived in formation, and we all piled aboard. Nobody raised any question about
our wounded who were carried in, although we’d all agreed that we would refuse to go without them.

So, in short order we were all back aboard the Caravaglia. The good news was that the medical facilities
there could take care of the wounded, and they were soon back on their feet. We were told that the High
Command was pleased with our performance, but pleas from several of us that Blackthorne’s exemplary
performance be borne in mind at his impending Court Martial fell on deaf ears, their reason being “This
mission didn’t happen". It was almost time for the formal dinner, so everybody was soon scurrying around
making final preparations and getting into their dress kit.

Back in my bunkroom, I had an opportunity to investigate the contents of the briefcase - with all the
preparations going on, when I asked Calvin where he wanted it he just said to hang onto it until after the
dinner! Inside was the Flight Status Recorder Unit, a flight recorder data cartridge “type 12" of 128Gb
capacity and two half-melted floppy disks. There were also some paper records, pretty much the worse for
wear by both fire and water - maps and notes and several ID cards. These were named to McDonald, Trent,
McFish and a couple which were more or less illegible - one the name ended "NES", the other you could
only read the number MC110717 on. Only one was a civilian red one, the rest were all CMC standard. Odd -
they’d told us that there were only 4 people aboard, and Zwalf’s ID was already accounted for.

So, on to the dinner. It’s the first such occasion I’ve attended, I was in hospital having my ear replaced after
Groombridge last year. Although I’m not too much of a one for parties, it wasn’t bad. Good food, anyway,
and I was sitting next to Marine Toric who I haven’t seen in over a year. He said he’d been on detached
duties, but had made a point of getting back for the dinner. I won’t bore you with an account of the evening,
but you will be as pleased as I was to hear that Zeus and Casselle were promoted to Marine First Class,
O’Shaunessy and Chaos confirmed as Sergeants and Ruby Axe made a Corporal. There were various
speeches from different people, including Calvin, who hosted the dinner, and Svjenson, who was Guest of
Honour. Apone made a speech too, and made some weird remark about how the Marines contained a great
range of people from me (!) to Fugazi. Why us? Talking of Fugazi, he’d turned up in a splendid outfit which
is formal dress on his home planet, Avalon. It seems that he’s the son of one of the feudal lords there, and
after dinner he got up and made a speech about how he had been taught a lesson in humility by Lieutenant
Kramer (actually, Kramer beat him up!) which had impressed his father, and so on said worthy’s behalf he
conferred the degree of Knighthood on a highly embarrassed Kramer - who looked decidedly worried when
Fugazi pulled out a big sword and asked him to kneel!

I think that’s about it for now. Apparently the next mission is already in an advanced state of planning, so it
should not be too long before I have another account for you. I’d just like to thank you again for appointing
me to your ceremonial bodyguard - several of the Marines commented on the badge, which I wore at the
dinner. There aren’t too many One True Church members, or at least, not that will admit to it. We do have a
worshipper of Arnie (Lieutenant Calvin), several Eighth Dayists and Rikki Tikki Tavi practises an ancient
Sol faith, and told me all about her audience with their equivalent of the ArchPrimate, who is called (I think)
The Papa. There was an announcement of your Consecration in Interstella, I’Il send you a cutting.

All my respects,

Mexal
