John,

Here’s the latest intercept of that Marine’s “Letters Home". Looks like they came close to buying it this time,
so you might want to look into exactly what those Stoppers’ orders were. I assume you’ve stopped the credit
transfers... Not that they’d be spending it anyway - our data indicates they decided to do the transfer on the
site of the first detonation and were glowing in the dark.

Tokyo’s having a fit over the geo-data - you know how it will affect our operations if Groombridge becomes
habitable again.

We’re still trying to trace the leak that let one of the letters out to the press - there’s some confusion as to
whether it’s an independant intercept on the transmission, or an intercept on our own data-net. TechDiv
expects to have answers by the end of the month. If its internal security that’s compromised, we may need to
expidite matters re the culprit(s).

Anyway - in the meantime, enjoy another good read!

Tomas

##### Message Text Begins

To: The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From: Sergeant Mexal, aboard the Garavaglia, in orbit around Groombridge.
Date: 24-04-2495.

Greetings!

The last time we went to Groombridge was bad enough, but this mission was worse. Too many people have
died, friends.... but I am getting ahead of myself. You’ll recall that Groombridge has been in the throes of
civil war for many years, although the events of November 2493 ended the fighting, along with the lives of
far too many of the planet’s inhabitants, as the effects of the nuclear device the terrorists detonated caused
massive geological damage. Most of the planet has been evacuated, but some people have insisted on
remaining, others want to return. A group of scientists, led by Professor Pruwitt, had devised a scheme to
release a pressure build-up in the planetary core by detonating further nuclear devices in a controlled manner
at carefully-selected sites, and they’d requested UW assistance. A group from 1 Coy had been sent with them
to Groombridge, and we were being sent to relieve them, our job being to protect and assist the scientists in
their work.

The night before we landed, I had to issue weapons and screens as usual. We had a couple of new recruits,
and some newcomers from other units. The recruits were Burke, who is a native of Groombridge, and Sabre.
One of the newcomers, Maxwell Rocktansky, also came from Groombridge. Then there was a chap called
Darling, and one with the strange name of Sad-Person. Once everybody was kitted out, RSM Honer called a
parade, and inspected everybody - all I got was a cursory glance and a grunt, but he had a good shout at some

people.

After the parade, Captain Zwalf gave a briefing, not that he had much to say. Just that we were going to
Groombridge, at the request of the UW, to replace 1 Coy, who are working with the scientists. They will have
time to show us around before they leave. Pruwitt’s plan, to explode nuclear devices to sort out the pressure
problems is, apparently, the best idea developed to date, hence the UW backing for it. However, the
environmentalists are objecting to the thought of further nuclear blasts, and the few locals left are not very
happy either. So that’s where we come in - the locals, and the tree-huggers for that matter, have a tendency to
express their objections through violent means. Apparently the media are also likely to be around. That was
all, just that we would go down in the dropship in the morning.

As soon as Zwalf left us, Honer was back, shouting at everybody to arrange the furniture in the main mess
room for what turned out to be a Board of Inquiry. This was to investigate the matter of Fugazi’s behaviour
on Connet, when he apparently stabbed one of the witches and O’Shaunessy. Martins and O’Shaunessy, who
were to be the main witnesses to testify, were sitting at one side of the room. Honer called the room to
attention as three people - Captain Finn, Lieutenant Jones and Master Sergeant Gibson - came in. Finn (not
someone I’ve even seen before) announced that he was presiding, and sat down. Fugazi - who was wearing
traditional Avelonian dress, with a tunic bearing his family arms - was marched in by Apone, and the
proceedings began. The charges were read out, being 

1. murder of the witch, 
2. assault on O’Shaunessy and
3. insubordination.

O’Shaunessy was called as the first witness. She said that the witch, who had been taken prisoner earlier, had
requested to visit the toilet, and had been allowed to do so, handcuffed to O’Shaunessy. While in there, she
had become very disorientated, and the next thing she’d been aware of was the witch heading out of the door
- still handcuffed to her - holding her sidearm. She’d then felt a stabbing pain in her back and had passed out,
the last thing she’d seen was the accused holding two knives, one of which had blood on. She was able to
identify the knives, which were in evidence bags.

In response to a question, she said that the body was not available because the witch, along with another and
Peace the witchfinder, had returned through the dimensional rift the next day. Although she’d certified death,
the witch had apparently returned to life the following morning. Martins had administered diazamorphite to
the witch, but no pulse had been discernible. Asked about her injuries, she said that she had four scars on her
back. Then she was asked if she could have been mistaken in thinking that the witch was dead, seeing as
she’d just been stabbed herself. She replied that she’d not examined the witch until after she’d been treated
herself, and that other medics present had agreed that the witch was dead.

Next, Corporal Martins was called to give evidence. He said that immediately after the incident he’d come
over from the far side of the room to find that both the witch and O’Shaunessy were suffering from severe
stab wounds. Being himself unable to treat injuries of that nature, he’d administered diazamorphite to
stabilise them and yelled for help. There was no evidence of IR injury, and he was certain that they were stab
wounds he was looking at. He recognised the knives as being Fugazi’s property, and as having been in his
possession at the time.

As background, he then explained that nearly everybody had been out on patrol, and that the only people in
the base had been O’Shaunessy and the prisoner, plus Fugazi and himself, who had been on standby in NBC
kit. When the prisoner and O’Shaunessy had visited the toilet, they’d come out and headed straight for the
base door. Fugazi had shouted “Stop” and had dived straight in, knives whirling. Martins had been at the far
side of the room, but had been unable to discern any visible reaction to Fugazi’s shout.

Captain Finn then announced a short recess, and returned about ten minutes later, when Surgeon Commander
Mimiannapandawawa was called. She testified that she was certain that the witch had been dead from the
stab wounds inflicted upon her, and yet she had been going around alive and well the next day. She had no
way to explain this. However, she believed that the witch had some strange powers, although she had no
knowledge of such matters. It did appear that the witch had been exerting some kind of mesmeric power over
O’Shaunessy.

Then to my utter astonishment, my name was called, and I was asked what light I could throw on the matter.
I pointed out that I had been leading a patrol at the time, and so had seen nothing; then I was asked if I’d seen
Fugazi threaten the prisoner at any other time. I told them that I had seen him wave a handful of salt - which
we'd been told they were sensitive to - at her, and explained how we’d used steel handcuffs to capture her in
the first place. They let me sit down again, and recalled O’Shaunessy.

O’Shaunessy said that after the incident she had come to the conclusion that the witch had exerted some kind
of power over her - she’d been very dazed and disorientated, and had not noticed the witch removing her
sidearm or leading her towards the door, not had she heard Fugazi’s challenge. She’d come out of her daze
the first time she was stabbed, but “Fugazi moves so fast” and she had passed out. She considered that the
amount of force used was “a bit unnecessary”.

Martins was then recalled, and asked about his management of the casualties. He said that he’d given
diazamorphite to the witch, and explained that it works by slowing and stabilising bodily processes for up to
24 hours. He’d been authorised to give it by Mimiannapandawawa. They tried to press him as to whether he
thought that the stab wounds had been fatal, but he refused to be drawn, just repeating that it was beyond his
competence to make that sort of judgement.

Next, Sergeant Turner was called as a character witness for Fugazi. He said that he had only been reassigned
to 5 Coy three months ago, and so did not know Fugazi well; but whenever he’d been under his command he
had acted as a good marine. At this point, Dibley interrupted from the back of the room, shouting something
about Fugazi being a Brotherhood supporter. Once Dibley had been told in no uncertain terms to be quiet,
Turner continued, saying that Fugazi had not shown over-aggressive tendencies, nor excessive use of cold
steel. He’d never been insubordinate, but had always been enthusiastic about his duties.

Then Fugazi was called, and caused a minor sensation by swearing to “tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help me Arnie”. (Everybody else had taken the conventional oath, except me - I’d
affirmed.) He stated that he freely admitted that he had stabbed both the witch and O’Shaunessy, but was
puzzled that a Board of Inquiry was being held. He’d acted in the best interests of the CMC. As far as he had
been aware, the witch was only vulnerable to salt and restraint with iron; and was immune to IR. He had
become suspicious when she had asked to go to the toilet, so he had covered the blades of his knives with
salt paste. The witch had left the toilet still handcuffed to O’Shaunessy, but apparently in charge of the
situation and holding O’Shaunessy’s sidearm, a Beretta 99E This was presented in an evidence bag, and he
identified it. He went on to say that he had been screened, and was in a screened building. When he had
shouted a challenge to them to halt, the witch had opened fire on him whilst attempting to open the door.
He’d charged in with his knives, believing that he was acting in the best interests of the Corps and of
O’Shaunessy in so doing. Once the door was open, the building screen was, of course, disrupted; and he had
fallen victim to IR, becoming unconscious. He believed that the witch heard his challenge, and had chosen to
ignore it. On being questioned further, he explained that he had prepared his knives whilst the witch was in
the toilet because he had formed the opinion that if anything was going to happen, that’s when, and he
wished to be prepared.

O’Shaunessy was then recalled, and asked to identify her sidearm. She said that it had been in her holster
when she had gone into the toilet, but she had no clear recollection of anything more, just that it had been in
the witch’s hand when they came out although she had no idea how it had gotten there. As far as she is
aware, Fugazi’s description of events is correct, although she does not recall his challenge or going towards
the door.

Fugazi was recalled and asked if he had stabbed O’Shaunessy. He declined to answer. The witch had fallen
with O’Shaunessy on top of her due to the handcuffs, and he had hit O’Shaunessy by mistake. He has
nothing against her, and would not intend to hurt her; must have been the heat of battle and so on. He said
that he had fought with blades since the age of five - his homeworld being very much into both competitive
tournaments and real duelling - and that he is “expert in all forms of close combat”. He agreed that he had
stabbed O’Shaunessy, but stated that it “was not a deliberate assault”. On being asked about the charges, he’d
said that the charges had been brought by Major Harris, but that he had refused to accept them until he had
had opportunity to seek legal advice.

After a brief recess, Captain Finn announced the Board’s conclusions.... or at least tried to. Dibley started
shouting again, saying that he wished to address the Board. He was told to be quiet, and Finn announced that
the charges of murdering the witch and insubordination were to be dropped. In the matter of the assault on

O’Shaunessy, Fugazi was to be referred for psychiatric evaluation and then tried by a Court Martial. He
asked Fugazi if he had anything he wanted to say, and Fugazi started yelling about insults to his honour, that
anyone saying that he was mad would have to answer for it in personal combat.... and was eventually led off
in handcuffs by Apone. After clearing up the room, the rest of us were sent off to our beds too.

Next morning, it didn’t take too long to get organised. Zwalf was in charge - Harris was busy, but should be
joining us later - and Sergeant Chaos was 2 i/c. The squads had been sorted, I was in Bravo, commanded by
Chaos with me (!) as squad 2 i/c. The rest of the squad were Dibley, Zeus, Sad-Person and Darling. The ride
down in the dropship was uneventful, and we were soon out on the planetary surface. From the drop point, it
was a Short walk to the base facility, within which we found four people, members of 1 Coy. A Sergeant
Walker, who was in charge of them, greeted Zwalf and briefed him on the area - pointing out known
radiation hot-spots and so on - then said he’d show us round. We were all called over to see where the
hot-spots were, and I scribbled notes on the map I’d brought with me (I like it when they tell me what planet
I’m going to before I get there!). Rather surprisingly, the 1 Coy people said that there was no building screen,
but before I could investigate further, Dibley asked if he could have an escort while he went out to take some
radiation readings for Mimiannapandawawa. Chaos told me to get on with it, so I took Sad-Person and
Darling and we guarded Dibley while he found places to measure radioactivity in air, water and soil.

Once we were back inside, and Dibley had reported to Mimiannapandawawa, guards were posted around the
base facility. I settled down to watch the area I was assigned, until Beck came along and said I had to go and
see the medics. I scuttled in, and was told that due to the radiation hereabouts, we all were to be given
desamine. We CoedArianese are more vulnerable, so I was given something called superdesamine, think it’s
double strength or something. Once Mimiannapandawawa had finished sticking needles in me, I went back
out on guard again. But not for long, soon we were all called in and Zwalf said that everybody was to go
with 1 Coy on a tour of the area. I asked to stay behind to see if I could jury-rig a base screen, and was given
permission to do so. Everyone else went off.

Guess it took me about half an hour, then I made a drink and waited for the others to return. When they did
come back, the four 1 Coy men were all handcuffed and under guard; and Zwalf had been disarmed. Then
Chaos called us all together and said that he was relieving Zwalf of command. Mimiannapandawawa said
that she was satisfied that he was unfit for duty.... then Zwalf became very agitated and ended up having to
be dragged off by Apone and one or two others and locked up!

After this excitement, Chaos held a debrief, saying that the 1 Coy men had made an unprovoked and vicious
attack on some civilians whom they had encountered, and so had been placed under arrest. Zwalf had
attacked Zeus and attempted to strangle her. He was going to arrange for a dropship to take both prisoners
and Zwalf up to the Garavaglia.... then told me that I had to take command of Bravo squad. Eeek! Haven’t
they noticed I’m a technical sergeant, not a field one!

One of the scientists turned up, but didn’t seem to want to talk to us apart from asking if we’d seen Professor
Pruwitt. Then he turned up as well, but was as reluctant to talk. I introduced myself as CED Chief, he just
grunted and said “Well, I suppose you know about explosives” and left. Then two locals arrived, saying that
they had walked for four hours to get here. They refused to say who they were or what they wanted, so
Chaos said that they should go away and come back in half an hour. They went off, looking disgruntled, and
I think they set up camp - some smoke could be seen in the distance.

Dibley came by and said that he needed to take more radiation measurements - I think they had to be taken at
regular intervals throughout the time we were on planet - so I rounded up the squad and provided him with
an escort. Back inside, Dibley presented his results to the medics, then we were sent to escort the prisoners
(and Zwalf) to the drop site to await the dropship to take them up to the Garavaglia. One of the prisoners -
Sergeant Walker - was out cold and had to be carried. When the dropship landed, Harris and Oslo got out. We
loaded the prisoners and Zwalf aboard, and escorted the new arrivals back to base. Once inside, Chaos
reported on events so far, and relinquished command to Harris, who had a couple of announcements: Oslo
had been promoted to full lieutenant and Beck to corporal.

Just then, those outside reported that they’d come under attack, so we went outside to help defend the base.
There were several aggressors, scampering around and sniping at us, mostly with heavy weapons. A running
battle ensued, and as each one fell I was called over to check the body with my scanner. Heavy weapons,
civilian screens, no ID and all fairly radioactive. When I was sent to check the third one, I found that his
weapon was emitting a worrying rising whine, so I went away swiftly. Off again, back into the fray, and the
next aggressor managed to get me - I guess I’d been taking hits all along, but I’d been a bit busy scanning
corpses to pay much attention.

I woke up to Ratch, who’d just given me defalicil and as soon as I’d opened my eyes told me to go and check
the body of the aggressor who’d shot me, who had been in his turn shot by some of the Marines. The
skirmish was still in progress, but after I°d checked this one - just the same as the others - I was sent inside to
report to Harris. O’Shaunessy came along, borrowed my map to brief Harris on the hot-spots and suggested
that due to the risk of contamination. I do all the checking and that everybody else should stay away. Seemed
reasonable to me. Anyway, I went back outside, and found a fellow in civilian dress running towards the
base. I checked him - decidedly radioactive - and so when he started going on about “They’re after me,
please help” told him that he couldn’t come in. More aggressors arrived, apparently in hot pursuit of this
chap, and he ran off. The pursuers promptly opened fire on us, and almost before I’d realised it my screen
had overloaded and I passed out.

I came round inside the base, O’Shaunesssy having just administered seven units of resusitant. Then she
borrowed my map, so that she could brief Harris on where the radiation hot-spots were. I hung around,
armouring screens - and mending one in which the power cell connector had come loose - then Harris called
everybody together for the inevitable general debrief. Chaos gave most of it, and covered our arrival and the
patrol with the 1 Coy personnel. It appears that when they had encountered some civilians, the 1 Coy people
had attacked on sight - apparently they were some of the local environmentalists and had been causing a
nuisance of themselves. Zwalf had ordered them arrested, then begun to strangle Sergeant Walker. Having
floored him, he’d turned to Dibley and said “You saw it, he started it”. When Dibley said he hadn’t seen
anything, Zwalf had turned to Zeus and said the same thing. She had replied that on the contrary, Zwalf
himself had started the fight, and so he’d tried to attack her as well. Back at base, Chaos had, with
Mimiannapandawawa’s agreement, relieved Zwalf of command. Sergeant Walker had suffered internal
injuries in the attack, and was given diazamorphite.

Harris then took over, and reminded us that our mission was to protect and escort the scientists: nothing else.
The rules of engagement were basically “hands off” due to the risk of contamination. On meeting anyone,
we should use the standard challenge, three times; if one’s own life or that of other marines is endangered we
should still await the command of whoever is in charge before opening fire. If we come under fire, we should
issue one loud challenge then return fire. The ERV, should the base be overrun, is the drop site.

Once the briefing was over, lunch was served. Then one of the scientists, who introduced himself as
Technician Willis, arrived. He said that he wanted us to go out and plant what he called “detonation probes”.
These were metre-long poles with spiked explosive tips, which we had to place in set positions within a
given time; they were set to go off simultaneously. Harris assigned one site to each of the three squads, and
we were sent off. Bravo squad (now thankfully with Chaos back in charge) set off along a track and off up a
hill to plant one probe, which Sad-Person was carrying, rather gingerly. We planted it in the assigned location
and made our way back to base without incident. Then we were told to go to Charlie squad’s location, they’d
run into some trouble and could use some help. So off we went again.

When we reached their position, we found that there were still a few snipers around, but they left when the
reinforcements arrived. Several people of Charlie squad - including Turner, who was in charge - were down.
Medics got to work, then I was called for - “You know EOD, don’t you? We have a suspected bomb on
Cassell”. I scuttled over. Someone told me that she’d been given diazamorphite, but that there was some kind
of box planted on her. I told everybody to clear the area - and had to get a bit sharp with Zeus who is, after
all, Cassell’s best friend - then went to check the situation.

Cassell, out cold, was slumped against a tree. She was wearing a rain poncho, and there was a small plastic
box apparently just resting on her chest. No wires or anything, just a flashing light and an audible bleep. |
looked around for a long stout branch, and by the time I got back with one I found that the box (still bleeping
and flashing) had slipped some way down her body without any apparent ill-effects. Excellent. Using the
stick in one hand I knocked the box to the ground, grabbed Cassell and ran for it. Some distance away, I
dropped her and looked back. Billows of smoke from the box, no sound of any explosion. Leaving Cassell,
and reminding the others that the area was not yet declared safe, I moved cautiously back, pausing at a safe
distance and observing through a telescope until the smoke had died down. Finding another stick on the way,
I then approached the box. Charred and melted, no more lights or noises. I poked it a couple of times, no
response; so I called the “All clear”.

Picking up the fallen, we returned to base to report. Once he was up again, Turner said that they had reached
their site, planted the probe then retreated to a safe distance to await its detonation. That’s when they’d been
attacked. It appeared that whoever the aggressors were, they had taken kit - drugs, maps and radios - from
the people they’d dropped, then injected them with diazamorphite and run off. With Cassell, they’d also left
the incendiary device. Cardinal suggested that the whole operation looked as if it were designed to slow us
down rather than to kill, and I suggested that it might be the work of the “tree-huggers”, environmentalists
who were quite happy to harass, to monkeywrench, but didn’t really want to cause us lasting harm. It
appeared that the aggressors knew each other, they worked together as a team. They’d been dressed in a
motley array of different camouflage gear, and had civilian screens mounted on military-style helmets.

Then another scientist turned up, introducing himself as Technician Good. Harris asked him about Willis - I
think he had some idea that Willis may have been playing his own game and had sent some of us into a trap -
but Good just said that he’d been busy with his own work and didn’t know what Willis had been doing. Just
then, the Professor and Willis came in, and thanked us for the results obtained. The Professor was saying
something about having another set of probes to be planted, then he would be ready to determine the places
where the main charges should be set; then my attention was distracted by movement outside. As I was just
by the door, I went out to have a look.

A woman with a young girl were approaching, but just as they reached the clear area at the foot of the base
steps, the woman ran off, leaving the girl standing there, Even at that distance, it was obvious that she was
ill, looked like radiation burns or sores on her face and hands, also some strange bluish-green staining of her
skin. I heard O’Shaunessy behind me, telling me to check her for radioactivity. I thought it was pretty
obvious, but I do what I’m told, got my scanner out and checked. Definitely contaminated, in a big way. I
reported this back, noticed that Martins and Krinly had come out, in full NBC gear. I asked the girl who she
was, and she replied that her name was Jenna, and she wanted us to kill her. I passed this message back too,
just getting the reply that she wasn’t to be allowed into the base. Martins and Krinly ducked back inside,
presumably to get further instructions. I could see quite a few people watching through the windows. Jenna
said that she was in great pain, and all she wanted was to die. The woman who had brought her here was her
mother. Meanwhile I was trying to use the scanner to see if I could pick up any more information about the
contamination she had, particularly the odd coloration.

Then she suddenly made a bolt for the door. I had no option but to grab her. Without Martins and Krinly as
backup, there was no guarantee that I could shoot her before she reached the door, and if she’d gotten
through it, there was no knowing how badly the whole base could have been affected. Foolish, perhaps, but
even in hindsight I can see no alternative, no other way of being certain that she would be prevented from
entering the base. One of those moments you hope you will never have to face - an instantaneous judgement
call, none of the alternatives being particularly palatable.

I stood holding Jenna - she seemed to take comfort from a hug and it was too late to worry about the wisdom
of giving her one! - telling her about the stars and how somewhere out there I was sure that there would be
someone able to save her. The base door opened, I could see one or two people peering out, and told them to
stay away. For a moment I saw O’Shaunessy, looking concerned, then Martins and Krinly came out, both
still in NBC suits. They spread out, then Martins came round behind me. I felt the muzzle of his sidearm
against my back, then in a flare of pain all went black.

Unmeasured time later - there’s no subjective passage of time when you’re unconscious, but it felt like a
long time - I opened my eyes, and only wanted to close them again. Felt lousy. A few voices, looked
around.... some of the Garavaglia medical team, wearing all manner of protective gear. They’ve been very
reassuring, they are certain that I shall make a full recovery. Since then, I’ve been trying to piece together
what happened since Martins shot me. Serves to pass the time - lying in the isolab is very dull! - and in some
ways maybe I’m better off than some.

Jenna, being unscreened, had been knocked out and I believe that she’d been left to drift from
unconsciousness to death. Sad, but perhaps for the best. Martins had been directed to administer
diazamorphite to me, and I’d been placed in isolation somewhere in a corner of the base facility. They'd
taken all manner of medical samples - blood and so on - which had been sent up to the Garavaglia for
analysis. The medics up there had quite understandably been saying that there was no way they'd allow me
to be sent up until they had determined the precise nature of the contamination and whether or not they could
Save me.

Meanwhile, the scientists had asked for another series of detonation probes to be set, which the Marines had
accomplished without difficulty. Then the Professor announced that he was ready to set off the main charges.
There were two, which had to be placed precisely and detonated simultaneously; so he was going to send
two of his technicians out to help. The Marines had split into two groups and gone out to the designated sites.
By now it was beginning to rain - they’d even had a local OTC preacher trying to get shelter in the base,
seems Turner is not too keen on having his soul saved from all accounts! - and one group was attacked in
force. In the confusion, the technician - and his bomb - disappeared, it wasn’t until they regrouped that they
noticed that he was missing. The weather was building up to a major electrical storm, and they couldn't even
raise the other group, who went ahead and detonated their charge. The storm broke, and everybody was
forced to retreat indoors for the night.

The next morning, the Professor had announced that he only had one further bomb; then the Garavaglia
announced that they’d received a coded message that they couldn’t understand. It said something about
“Burke” and Harris had wondered if it was anything to do with the recruit of that name, who’d been being
pretty argumentative all the previous day; but Burke had denied all knowledge of it. They’d managed to
decode it to get a grid reference, so went out there in force and found the renegade technician, plus bomb and
a bunch of heavily-armed mercenary types - there’s a rumour that one said he was Xeno Corps Security, but
how much reliance can be placed on that I don’t know - and succeeded in encircling their position and
recovering the bomb.

Now armed with two charges, the Professor directed them to revised detonation sites. By now the area,
already radioactive, was even worse since the bomb that went off last night, and the charges themselves were
quite dangerous. Advice was that nobody, even in protective gear, should carry them for more than ten
minutes. Burke and Maxwell, both natives of Groombridge, volunteered on the grounds that not only was it
their homeworld the Marines were attempting to save, but that also they have greater than normal resistance
to radiation. I don’t know all the story, but eventually they managed to plant the charges and returned to the
base.

Back at the base, a decontamination facility had been set up, and everybody was required to pass through.
This is when, and [ still think of it with tears, they found that several Marines had adsorbed fatal doses of
radiation and had mere days to live. Then these brave souls decided to remain on the planetary surface to
monitor the results of the detonations. Their names deserve to be remembered for ever: - Harris, Chaos,
Zeus, Cardinal, Miller, Darling...... some people I have served with for years, others I have known only
briefly. The Marines are still in a state of shock.

The survivors, once they’d passed through decontamination, were brought back up to the Garavaglia in the
dropship. By then, the medlab staff had decided that they would be able to treat me, so I was brought up and
placed in the isolab. At least with videolinks I’ve been able to speak to some of the others, who are all quite
understandably fairly subdued. Burke came by several times, and told some story that after I’d been shot by
Martins, Harris had called me eleven kinds of idiot and declared that if I survived he had every intention of
“busting my ass straight to hell”. Would that he were here to do so! Apparently, he thought I should have
attempted to shoot Jenna, rather than endanger myself. Burke had taken exception to this, and had told Harris
off, saying something about “At least she cared”. Wish I’d seen that!

O’Shaunessy came visiting too, and said that she’d ordered Martins to shoot me as she could see no other
way of dealing with the situation. Both she and Mimiannapandawawa had been very worried due to my
abnormal sensitivity to radiation, and so had decided that the best plan was to knock me out and move me
into isolation, using diazamorphite to slow all body processes until they’d completed analyses and treatment
could begin.

There is not much more to be said. The Garavaglia is remaining in orbit around Groombridge until the
results of the Professor’s explosions can be determined. It has to work - it would be too much to bear if the
sacrifices of our friends were to have been for nothing. The CMC High Command have announced
promotions for all those brave souls left on the surface, Harris to Lieutenant Colonel, Chaos to Lieutenant
and the remainder to Sergeant. Perhaps there will be some posthumous medals as well, none more deserved.

The remainder of the Marines will suffer no ill effects from their exposure, the decontamination procedures
were sufficient to avoid them. My recovery will be slower, I shall probably have to spend a week or two at
the very least here in the isolab, but they are certain that I will be able to return to duty with no lasting
problems. Guess I’ve been fortunate - the Lord has watched over me yet again.

I shall write again when I have more news,

All my respects,

Mexal
