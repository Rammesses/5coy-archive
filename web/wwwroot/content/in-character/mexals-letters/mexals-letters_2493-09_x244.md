The Reverend Elder Belzakath
High Forest Hall,
Coed'Arian.

June 28, 2493.

To Marine Mexal,
Greetings.

Your latest letter has been circulated amongst the Elders and the High Command, and has caused much
interest. We knew little of the Colonial Survey Department, as CoedArian made contact with the United
Worlds rather than the other way round - and if the people you encountered are any example, this is probably
just as well!

Professor Galpin was very interested in the news of the simian creatures that you encountered - he’ll
probably want to talk to you in person next time you visit CoedArian and in the meantime is pestering the
Colonial Survey Department and any other United Worlds body he can find for further details. By the way,
he compliments you both on your powers of observation and your methods of attempting to make contact.
Apparently the imitative approach is the approved manner of establishing communication. You’d better be
careful, Galpin will probably try to recruit you!

As for the rest, we - or at least General Tassach - have encountered representatives of both Alfatek and
Nu Phoenicia He says that he prefers the Alfatek people, who seem more straightforward and trustworthy.
He would, however, be grateful if you could ascertain how these two are regarded both by the Marines and
by the United Worlds in general.

I spoke to Doctor Batigh about this “cyclazine”. He has not yet encountered it, but will speak with the
United Worlds people and check that neither it nor any of the other specialist drugs used in conjunction with
incapacitating radiation have any adverse indications as far as our people are concerned. Fortunately, he is of
the opinion that our metabolism and physiology is similar enough to that of humans that no problems are
likely, although he thinks that we may be slightly more susceptible to incapacitating radiation - not enough to
cause a problem, it is just likely that higher levels of resusitant may be required. At least I think that is what
he said.

Again you are commended for a comprehensive report.

My blessings rest upon you,

To: The Reverend Elder Belzakath & all my friends back home.
From: Marine Mexal, on board the Caravaglia, Sirent Cing System.
Date: 27-06-2494.

Greetings!

Safely back in the Caravaglia, and with some tale to tell! After Groombridge last year I didn’t think anything»
could be as bad......

The mission orders were fairly straightforward, if somewhat alarming. We were being sent to a planet
designated X244 in the Sirent Cing System. A couple of years ago, a Colonial Survey Department team had
reported finding “alien artefacts”, or so they claimed, there and 3 Company of the Colonial Marines had been
sent to assist them. Just before the Marines went in, contact with the CSD team had been lost, but this was
put down to bad weather - they’d reported an advancing storm front earlier. The dropship went in, and as
they descended communications deteriorated rapidly. The last transmission had something about violently
fluctuating levels of hard radiation (H/R in UW terminology, to distinguish it from IR). Then the Valhalla,
their ship, had totally lost contact.

Naturally, this caused a fair degree of concern as time passed and contact could not be re-established with
either CSD or Marines. The whole system was declared closed, and a specialist threat team sent in to sort
things out. They began by launching atmospheric probes from their dropship, but all four launched
malfunctioned. Then they tried to have a look themselves from low orbit.... and the last heard from them was
a garbled transmission about navigational systems failure. By this time, the Groombridge situation was
beginning to escalate, and rather than follow the matter up, the system was placed under interdiction, with
plenty of beacons set in nearby space to warn people off. Not that everybody listened - some four ships
ignored the warnings and insisted on going in. Again, contact was lost with all of them, and never
re-established.

So, in the course of time it was decided to send in a team from the Immediate Response Battalion of the
CMC - in other words, us. The Caravaglia was to remain on the edge of the system, from whence we were to
go in - cautiously! - in our dropship. With us we had various personnel from the Colonial Survey Department
and a couple of others.

The night before the drop, Major “Fluffy Bunny” Harris called us all together in a mess room somewhat too
small for the crowd to give us a final briefing. He began by reading out the mission orders, which contained
the above story, and covered one or two administrative matters. One good bit of news was that Chaos has
been confirmed in appointment as a corporal, and made acting sergeant. Then the door opened and one of the
CSD team - who had until then kept themselves to themselves - came in. He introduced himself as Dr.
Crouch, the team medic, and said that as they had no knowledge of the planetary environment, bugs &c., we
were to be very careful and should report any injury causing a break in the skin to either him or our own
medics immediately.

Harris continued with his briefing (Crouch stayed to listen), telling us that our primary objective is plain
search and rescue, to locate the missing personnel - CSD, Marines, threat team and the crews of the private
ships that ignored the interdiction order. Then we are to assist the survey team in their investigations.

Crouch then said that the original CSD team were good survivalists, and unless something or someone had
actually attacked them they are likely to have stayed alive. Not much is known about the private ships,
although one belonged to Intelcorp, who had sent a representative on this mission.

Harris then finished up by saying that he and the CSD team leader would be in joint command, and that we
must be prepared to cope with the civilians. Then back to administration - Zwalf told Dibley that he was on a
charge for having failed to produce his med reports from the last mission (the one I missed, to Hal), and
Harris announced that Waylander, out of jail for the time being, was still under open arrest pending his trial
on various charges. By then it was getting quite late and we were sent off to our beds. As I went, I bumped
into Colonel Svjenson, and commented that we were being dropped in it this time. “Yes” he said, “Up to
here, or in your case right over your pointed ears!”

Next morning there was the inevitable inspection - RSM Honer in full voice, although Dibley and I, who
were bunking together, were complemented on having our kit in good order - and a parade, at which we were
introduced to the CSD team. Their commander is Dr. Jones, and as well as Crouch there’s Dr. Dianne
Bellamy (a botanist) and Dr. West, who will be studying the meteorology of the planet, which by all accounts
is quite interesting, i.e. very variable! As well as them, there were two or three other civilians around - a UW
representative called Dr. Lockett, a Mr. Finch from Intelcorp and a pilot called Biggles. We were all required,
in turn, to state our names and ranks.

Then the civilians wandered off about their own affairs, and we got on with the final preparations for the
landing. We were quite a small party, only about 20 or so Marines, and I ended up in a Squad, under the
command of Captain Zwalf, along with Waylander, Quark, Stryker, Emma Rell (who I don’t know) and
Sergeant Apone, who would be 2 i/c and, along with Stryker, a team medic. Then, greatly to my surprise, I
was Called over and told that I was chief armourer for this mission! Although Dibley is also an armourer, and
an MFC, they’d decided that as he’s a med-tech as well he had enough to cope with. I was ordered to issue
MS-CMC screens to the civilians - Finch seemed to think that wearing a helmet would detract from his
style... well, he may have thought his suit looked good, but I reckon he looked a bit of a mess. The rest were
reasonably happy, although all had to have the operation of the screens explained to them.

Whilst I was showing Dr. Crouch how to operate his screen, he peered at me for a moment, then said “You’re
the one from CoedArian, aren’t you? I remember that there was some debate as to whether or not your
people should be allowed off planet at all.” I pointed out that we had come out and found the United Worlds,
not the other way round, and he conceded that it might have proven difficult to stop us. He continued to eye
me curiously, however. I had this nasty feeling that he wanted to settle down and study me!

Then Sergeant O’Shaunessy called us all over, and announced that due to the dangerous levels of hard
radiation on X244, we were all to be given injections of something called dezamine, which would provide
protection for 24 hours - this would be repeated as long as we stayed on the planetary surface. Everyone had
to state their home planet - I think that differing doses were given depending on the background radiation
that you are used to. O’Shaunessy was working closely with a friend of hers, a med-tech called Adder who is
a limited telepath, although he cannot speak. I’m not sure of the whole story, but I believe that this is the
result of accident or injury rather than his natural state. He can only communicate properly with
O’Shaunessy, but I was able to reach a limited understanding with him - at least he can hear what is said to him even if he cannot respond.

Once that was dealt with (and Apone had stopped moaning, he hates injections!) the UW representative, Dr.
Lockett, addressed us. She said that she was a civilian consultant employed by the UW to train the front line
forces in the procedures for alien contact. If such a contact was even suspected, a special code word was to
be given by whoever made the contact. The area should be immediately secured and a report made back to
our commanders. At least two people should watch and record everything that happens, while a single
individual - preferably whoever actually made and called the contact - should be the only one to attempt
communication. This person should, naturally enough, be careful, make no sudden movements and speak
clearly. They should attempt to establish communication and, if possible, determine whether the “alien” is
sentient. The note-takers should record everything - number and appearance of the contacts, sounds made,
gestures, scents, even any feelings experienced by the observers. Above all, no matter what the provocation,
it is totally forbidden to open fire on a suspected or actual alien contact - even if it’s trying to eat you.
(Running away is allowed!)

Finch, meanwhile, was engaged in a fair bit of argument with Fluffy Bunny. Apart from the comment “Don’t
go wrecking things” and saying that the Intelcorp people believed to be on planet were communications
personnel and observers, he was refusing flatly to give any indication of Intelcorp’s interest in the area. Not
surprisingly, Fluffy Bunny didn’t like this one little bit.

Jones then called me over, and got me to make a note of the names and specialities of the original CSD team.
There were eight of them - Dee Saunders (Contact specialist), Bo Debante (geologist/seismologist), Ishwan
Quixote (botanist), Orlando McDonald (physics & chemistry), Brett Williams (meteorologist), Sean
Corrington (medic), Jairam Kahn (security) and JoBeth Candith (xenobiologist). Waylander was hovering
around waving an autovox recorder, so I read the list back to him.

As usually seems to happen, somehow during the night, The Voice had appeared. The usual collection of lies
and half-truths, including comments about the NCO training course (which I agreed with, what were the
Special Forces doing with projectile weapons) and a dig at poor Quark and his calling of “Contact” on a
rock. And a couple of comments about me - calling me a “pointy-eared caterpillar” and something about the
non-return of my personal file. Which still hasn’t turned up, by the way. It’s beginning to get rather
annoying.

Talking of lies and half-truths, there was a rather disturbing article in the latest Interstella, something about a
5 Coy med-tech refusing drugs to elves on the grounds that it was a waste of resources.... being the only elf
around I’d like to know where the story came from, I’ve not encountered any adverse comments from our
medics.

By now all the final preparations were complete and the Marines, the CSD team and Finch all settled down
in the dropship. Biggles was, I’m not quite sure why, at the controls. Over the intercom we could hear the
familiar voice of Corporal Hunter, who was at the helm of the Caravaglia. We launched from quite far out,
about the heliopause, and headed in towards X244. As we reached the outer fringes of the atmosphere,
Hunter was heard again, something about they’d picked up a distress signal and were going to investigate,
but would return for us as soon as possible.

That’s when things started to go wrong. The descent was wild, one of the roughest rides I’ve had, Biggles
could be heard almost panicking as various control systems cut out. There was a lot of atmospheric
turbulence, and we were all thrown around so violently that most if not all of us passed out. Biggles must

have somehow managed to hang on, when I regained consciousness we were on the ground. Battered and
shaken, no serious injuries, and much equipment damaged. Many people reported that their timepieces had
stopped during the descent. Fortunately, the ship itself was still in working order.

As we all got ourselves sorted out, somewhere in the distance there was a loud bang and something which
those looking the right way said was a distress flare went up. Leaving the rest of us to get a basic camp set
up, Fluffy Bunny and Waylander went off to have a quick scout around. They came back quite swiftly,
having had the sense not to go too far. Dr. Jones was very eager to begin searching for the missing CSD
team, and the rest of his people were forever trying to wander around - I had to fetch Dr. Crouch back several
times, he appeared to have no idea of personal safety, and sometimes I thought I would have to breach all
protocol and haul him back unceremoniously by the collar!

Once Fluffy Bunny was back, he ordered Zwalf’s a squad to accompany the CSD team in the shuttle, which
Biggles was to fly, in the direction from which the noise had come. Biggles had picked up some kind of
beacon signal in the same direction, and so it was decided to home in on that. We all piled in and set off. I
think Fluffy Bunny had intended Finch to go along too, but he refused and stayed in the base camp.

The trip began peacefully enough. I was right at the rear, by a window, and watched the woods and open
grassland below. Despite nice sunny weather, just a few fluffy white clouds, there was considerable clear air
turbulence, and then the electronic systems began to fail. Biggles wrestled manfully with the controls but to
no avail, and the shuttle crashed just at the edge of some woods, cartwheeling and breaking up, scattering
personnel and equipment. I staggered to my feet, for a few horrible moments I thought I was the only
survivor, then heard Zwalf alternately cursing and retching - he’d taken a blow to the head, passed out
momentarily but was now all right although feeling sick. Others were less well off: Quark had dislocated a
Shoulder, Stryker had a sprained ankle, Emma Rell was in great internal pain, throwing up and retaining a
bare grip on consciousness, Apone had been knocked out. As far as I could see, all the CSD were dead -
Crouch was stretched out on the ground with most of his gizzards beside him. While Zwalf checked
everybody ‘s condition, I held Emma’s head and tried to comfort her. There was no sign of injury, but she was
in great pain, sick and burning up with fever. All the shuttle’s communication gear was wrecked and nobody
had a personal radio with sufficient range to raise the base.

As the one in the best shape, I volunteered to go back to the base to summon assistance from the other squad,
but Zwalf decided to send Waylander. He’d no compass, so I told him the bearing (2000) and loaned him
mine. He’d hardly set off across the grassland, however, when the welcome sight of Fluffy Bunny at the head
of most of the remainder of the Marines came into sight. In short order, the injured were treated and assisted
to their feet, and the bodies gathered up. This is when we made the disquieting discovery that some of the
CSD team’s corpses had simply disappeared. All that remained was a trail of blood leading off. Waylander
and one or two others investigated but could find nothing, although there were a few reports of sightings of a
shadowy form, indistinct and fast moving. Whatever, it didn’t seem like a good idea to remain here, and we
were soon on the move, back to the base camp.

Back in camp, guards were posted and Fluffy Bunny gathered us together for a briefing. He got us to recount
all that we could remember from the shuttle crash, and said that once he’d lost radio contact with us - he’d
been chatting with Zwalf at the time Biggles had lost control - he’d tracked in by remotely triggering the
SARBe that’s standard equipment on a shuttle. All the CSD team, Biggles and Marine Emma Rell had died:
the rest of us had survived although most had suffered at least minor injury. Quark was moaning that he’d
just had his dislocated shoulder replaced by Cardinal when Dibley had grabbed him by the shoulders and
nearly put it out again! Some of the bodies had disappeared mysteriously, indications being that there is a
large predatory creature in the vicinity. Both Waylander and Apone had seen glimpses of a shadowy,
rapidly-moving form, possibly a giant cat. A trail of blood leading off had been observed, but a brief patrol
in that direction had revealed nothing.

Little had been recovered from the crash, although some specimens of local plant life had been picked up.
Meanwhile, a more disquieting discovery had been made, the maps we had been issued bore no relationship
to the surrounding terrain, although we did appear to be at the intended co-ordinates on the planet. So it was
decided that the immediate priority tasks were to map the area, investigate the shuttle crash site to see what
could be recovered and start general patrolling to find out what’s going on. Calvin and his b squad set out for
the crash site forthwith. Finding myself without anything to do, I settled down to investigate the plant
samples - with the CSD botanist dead my early training in botany makes me the obvious one to deal with it.
O’Shaunessy hovered around, mostly wanting to make sure that I didn’t come to any harm.

Somewhere in the distance I could hear Fluffy Bunny arguing with Finch. He was still refusing to tell Harris
what Intelcorp’s interest in this planet is, just saying something about “It’s not relevant to here”. Fluffy
Bunny was getting irate, and said that he would not be best pleased if he found out that Finch had been
withholding information that could be of use to the Marines in their mission. They moved away, still arguing,
and I continued with my examination of the plants. Then I heard Fluffy Bunny calling my name and
scampered over, to be ordered to issue Finch with an IR hand weapon. I suppose that they had come to some
kind of agreement. Anyway, I did what I was told, and, despite Finch having had to have the MS-CMC
explained to him earlier, he appeared totally familiar with the weapon.

I returned to my plant specimens. It consisted of a single bright orange fleshy fruit with papery remains of
petals virtually enveloping it. Obviously fully ripe, it gave the impression of being somewhat further
developed than other vegetation in the area. I dissected one out - O’Shaunessy fussing about my touching it,
so I used tweezers and a knife, avoiding actual contact - and found that although a single fruit, it contained
numerous small seeds distributed throughout the fleshy interior. The flesh was juicy, and had a sweetish,
musky smell. O’Shaunessy and I discussed it, I thought that it might be edible and she was quite adamant
that she didn’t want me to try it! We decided to wait until Calvin’s mob got back from the crash site, maybe
some of the analysis equipment had survived.

Meanwhile, those on guard had been reporting signs of movement and the odd growl or snarl from the
nearby forest, although nobody had gotten a clear view of the creature. I had a close look at one smallish tree
which was showing considerable variation - some specimens were still in flower whilst others were setting
seed. Although a different plant from the one I had been examining, there were similarities - again a single
fruit. I showed it to O’Shaunessy, although I think she was getting a bit bored with botanical research. From
what I recall, her main interest is cybernetics, although she did have a passing interest in herbalism for a
while. She wandered off, I think she wanted to check her medical supplies.

Musing about the plants - nice to get back to some pure research after years of military life! - I was startled
clean out of my boots by a snarl and a clash of teeth seemingly immediately behind me. I turned, yelping in
astonishment, but could see nothing, although the forest edge was a good twenty metres away from where I
was standing. Others came to see what had startled me, but we couldn’t see anything.

Just then, a lone human female wandered in, who was immediately recognised by Finch as one of his people
and he took her aside. I did my best to eavesdrop, while pretending to examine my botanical specimens, but I
think Finch got wise to it, making a few rude comments about a “pointy-eared little fart” following him
around! Fortunately, his obsession with me enabled others to sneak up and listen. Not that much was heard -
just him saying “Don’t say anything at all” to her, and some comments about most of the people on the
planet still being alive. It transpired that her name was Johnson, and she was extremely nervous, even going
to the lengths of asking Finch if it was safe to drink the coffee she was being offered.

Other people could be seen observing our camp from a distance, and Johnson said that she didn’t deal with
them, something about they’d attacked with IR. Eventually, Finch decided that he was going to go off with
Johnson to where the rest of the original Intelcorp team were. They did not want any escort, but I was
ordered to issue Johnson with a screen and check Finch’s screen and weapon out before they left, which I
did.

Not long after they’d gone - saying that they would probably be gone a day or two - we had some more
visitors. This was a pair of civilians, human males, who said that they had come here hunting artefacts,
which they intended to sell. Apparently they’ve been here two years, as their ship had crashed on landing,
but have collected two crates-full of artefacts. One interesting point is that they were certain that the planet
on which we stood was X243, not X244. (Both these planets are in the Sirent Cing system’s habitable band.)
This could explain the discrepancy between the map and the ground truth. I also noticed that one of them had
some fern-like vegetation taped to one of his arms - he explained it as being a local plant which had
medicinal properties.

Just as these two departed, Calvin’s mob returned. They reported that virtually nothing had survived from
the shuttle crash, everything being well smashed. All bodies had gone. All they had was one crate, which
was put in the command tent under guard - I never did discover what was in it! Once fed, and b squad
rested, we of a squad were sent off on patrol, into the forest behind the camp, where the creatures appeared to
be. Fortunately, we didn’t meet any of them, but what we did meet was probably worse - The Brotherhood!
To our dismay, at least one had a projectile weapon, but he managed to evade us, along with a companion
although we killed three of them, who had been armed with IR weapons only. During the patrol, I also found
specimens of the fern-like plant that the civilian artefact-hunter had claimed had medicinal properties, and I
passed it over to O’Shaunnessy on our return.

Back at base, everything was quiet, with all of us taking turns to stand guard. Fluffy Bunny eventually called
us together, a couple of documents had come into his hands which he wanted to discuss. The first, dated
20-10-2491 was to General Sullivan at CMC HQ from Surgeon Lieutenant Diamond, which had been copied
to Colonel Nasco, CMC Area Command and the “Station Commander”. Interesting names to begin with.
Diamond used to be chief medic for 5 Company, and was an elf, or at least of genetically-modified stock
with pointed ears. She was removed from the Company on the planet Altair TV during 2491 by Nasco, who
was later discredited and has spent the last few years on the run. Nobody has known just where Diamond’s
been since then. The Station in question appears to be a CMC research base on X243..... looking even more
likely that we’re on the wrong planet!

Diamond's letter concerned accident statistics at this research base. Apparently both fatal and non-fatal
accidents were frequent, and she was of the opinion that safety regulations were both poorly formulated and
generally disregarded. As the Station Commander considered her investigations a “waste of time” and other
personnel were being evasive on the matter she was, as medical officer, reporting her concern directly to
CMC HQ.

The second letter was from the Station Commander to Nasco, dated 01-11-2491, and was all about Diamond.
He said that she'd settled in well, and was getting on with her work, but was showing unusual psychological
reactions in that she was refusing to discuss her previous colleagues but attempted repeatedly to make
contact with them, which had not been allowed due to the secret nature of the station’s work. He ended by
Saying that he intended to give her some “hands on experience of the experimental equipment”.

Just what has been going on here we have no idea. Calvin reported having found a board reading “Welcome
to The Slaughterhouse” near some derelict buildings, presumably the remains of the base, but no other
indications of what was going on. Speculation was rife, including suggestions that the creatures - giant cats
or whatever - were the results of experiments that had gone wrong, or at least got out. Apone and I were both
expressing surprise that a creature as large as they appeared to be was able to survive, given the lack of
suitably-sized prey... and about the absence of any droppings. Were they invisible?

Then a running figure, human, was spotted, intercepted and brought into the base. He gave his name as
Stephenson, and said that he’d been kept in the dark, and didn’t want to go back to the Slaughterhouse. He
said he’d recognised and run away from The Brotherhood, but before we could get anything else out of him
he ran off again. We settled down to the guarding routine again, disturbed once when one of these cat
creatures managed to sneak up close enough to claw poor Quark’s back and make off again before anyone
got a good look at it.

Shortly thereafter, Lieutenant Oslo was ordered to take out a fighting patrol to see what he could find.
Lieutenant Calvin, Apone, Waylander and I were sent a little way into the forest as backup. Oslo’s people,
however, found nothing except the remains of the Intelcorp man, Finch, which the cats had apparently
missed. I suggested leaving it where it was, hiding and waiting to observe the cats taking it, but the
suggestion didn’t go down too well, and we returned to the base, corpse and all. We got back to mayhem -
several Brotherhood were attacking the base from the far side. We all joined in the battle enthusiastically,
some charging straight through the camp and some, like me, circling round to come at the aggressors from
the side. Eventually they were beaten off, although I’m not sure just how, or if any of them were killed - I
took several hits and regained consciousness to the familiar sound of someone moaning about how I get
through their drug supply, it appears that they had had to give me the maximum dose of nine units of
resusitant. (I wonder if that’s the origin of Interstella’s rumour that someone didn’t want to treat elves.... a
misinterpretation of the ongoing tale that I always need a lot of resusitants.)

Once order was restored, Lieutenant Calvin, Apone, Waylander and I were sent out to investigate the
location of the beacon that the shuttle had been attempting to find when it crashed. Using a bearing I’d taken
at the crash site, and working out the relative positions from the base camp, we soon found the place in
question - and discovered that it was the site of the ruins and the sign reading “Welcome to the
Slaughterhouse” reported earlier. Hunting around, we found an aerial mounted half way up a tree. This could
have been transmitting the signal, a quick bearing I took before Apone climbed up to get it down showed that
it was pointing in the right direction. It certainly was capable, with the correct equipment behind it, to reach a
receiver in orbit. More than anything else in our possession was capable of, and if we were right about being
on the wrong planet, reaching the Caravaglia to organise retrieval was going to be imperative!

Back at the base, we found that the rest had been out patrolling, and fighting. I was soon busy repairing
screens, although I never did find out just who they’d been fighting this time. Probably more Brotherhood.
Chaos, Adder and Stryker were missing in action, and patrols were already underway to search for them.
Alas, only Chaos was found, he’d been chewed by one of the cats but was still alive. The other two could not
be found, probably ended up as cat food.

We then had a series of “visitors” - being on guard duty most of the time, I had good opportunity to watch
them arrive. First of all came a ragged and tatty individual, whose clothing appeared to be military in nature,
what was left of it. He had neither weapon nor screen, and appeared to be totally insane, or possibly under
the influence of some psychotropic substance. Eventually, after a lot of shouting from both Fluffy Bunny and
RSM Honer, it transpired that he was Second Lieutenant Dominic Sanderson of 3 Coy, but could give little
information on the other survivors on planet, nor about what had happened here. After Sanderson had spent
some time with Fluffy Bunny, he insisted on being allowed to go, and left, refusing any offers of assistance,
weapon, screen &c.

Then the Intelcorp employee, Johnson, came in sight, accompanied by five other people, all human. Again
they had no weapons or screens, and they all acted very scared. Calvin came out to talk to them, I stood off
to one side, observing. They were invited in, and eventually agreed, although they weren’t at all happy, and
eyed us nervously. They were taken to Fluffy Bunny’s command tent, but before he had time to come and
talk to them, the “artefact hunters” arrived, also wishing to talk to him. He went out to them, and again |
lurked in a good position to take action if any was required. There were three of them this time, and they said
that The Brotherhood had only been here a few weeks, but like everyone else, their ship had crashed and they
were stranded. They also knew of the presence of some Marines who “didn’t want to be found”, saying that
Nasco had sent them here to die because they had been “nasty to him”, and so they didn’t want to go back at
all. Apparently they live in some caves on an escarpment a few kilometres away. However, the hunters, who
gave their names as O’Donnell, brothers, would like to find a way off-planet, provided that they can bring
their crates of artefacts along, and said that they had some equipment that could help us establish contact
with our ship. They promised to come back in the morning, and - after enjoying some food - went off.

By then it was coming up to dinner time, and I was cornered by RSM Honer and ordered to make hot drinks,
and then bring food, for the Intelcorp personnel, who were closeted with Fluffy Bunny. Once I’d finished
playing waiter, it was time for us all to eat, and soon thereafter I was back on guard duty yet again. I was at
one end of the camp near the forest edge, and could hear movement in the undergrowth. Listening to it, and
to the behaviour of the local avian life, I came to the conclusion that someone was sneaking around there -
quite competently too, to give them credit. Without making any noise, I signalled my suspicions to Dibley,
who was nearby guarding in a different direction, and sent him off to warn the camp. Then I took up a
position near the most likely place for whoever was in there to come out, should they be wishing to mount an
attack on us, but where they wouldn’t be able to spot me.

Shortly thereafter, two Brothers appeared! Evil smirks on their faces, they looked around at the camp,
searching for a likely target to snipe at. That’s when I popped up and loosed several shots in their direction.
The comments they made indicated their displeasure, something of the order of “Oh BUGGER!”, and they
tried to shoot back, but couldn't get a line on my position. I continued to lay down fire on them, shouting
“Contact” as I did so, then Calvin and others came to the edge of the camp and a general firefight was soon
in progress. Calvin shouted to me, ordering me to return to the safety of the camp, and I did as I was told.
Needless to say, that’s when the Brothers finally were able to target on me, and took their revenge. As I
reached the outermost line of tents, my screen overloaded, and I went down, yelping.

I regained consciousness to a familiar and unpleasant sensation - cyclazine! This had been administered by
O’Shaunessy, who had dragged me into the limited protection afforded by one of the tents. There seemed to
be a running battle in progress all around, and she was soon off to attend to someone else, telling me to stay
put as I was still unscreened. I yelled for an RVC, and one was tossed in my direction in short order, then I
was able to repair my own screen and, once protected, venture forth and fix screens as necessary. Meanwhile,
the Brotherhood were beaten off or killed, and a patrol went out in pursuit of the last one, who was found
dead, half-eaten by one of the cats, or so it appeared.

Once peace and quiet was restored, Apone and I stood chattering. I don’t quite recall what had particularly
caught his attention, but he was saying something about how Fluffy Bunny had done something a bit
untowards - I think if was something like going for a sweep through the nearby forest without troubling to
tell anyone where he’d gone. Anyway, Fluffy Bunny overheard, and a bellow of “Get in here, Apone” was
heard from the command tent. My mischievous side took over and as he obeyed, I called out “When do you
want me to come and fetch the body, sir?”.... followed by the sinking feeling of having made a mistake as the
response came back “Mexal, you can come in here too.” Oops. I went over and followed Apone in, then
Fluffy Bunny told me to shut the door. I contrived to do this with myself on the outside, and scuttled off.
Only to have Calvin stick his head out and call me back. The words “no escape” came to mind.

“This isn’t what you think, Mexal”, Fluffy Bunny began. “I wanted to say that you have been doing a very
good job as an armourer.” I thanked him, and was startled as he continued “Would you like to receive further
armourer training, with a view towards becoming the senior armourer?” Naturally, I said yes, and I was then
allowed to go, rather dazed by all this. Shortly thereafter, Fluffy Bunny emerged and called everybody
together for the inevitable debrief. He told us that the Intelcorp people had part of a communications device
which, combined with the aerial we’d found and a couple of other bits which apparently are in the hands of
the O’Donnells, can be assembled into an uplink transmitter capable of reaching the Caravaglia once she
returns to the system. As the Intelcorp people are very paranoid, he’s agreed to leave them the uplink so that
they can organise their own pickup once we’ve gone.

We were interrupted by three Brothers who, for no apparent reason, mounted a suicide attack on us.
Naturally, they were swiftly dealt with, but Fluffy Bunny decided that he’d had enough of this and so we
went out in force towards the place it was thought they had camped for the night. The plan was to advance in
two waves, straight through, with the second wave (in which I found myself, buddied with Quark) passing
through the first to provide the final assault. By now it was getting dark, and ahead in the distance we could
see a camp fire. Then a flare went up - not sure if they’d spotted us or someone had found a trip wire the hard
way - and the charge was on. The first wave went in hard and we followed up, initially at a walking pace in
extended line, then speeding up until we charged through the others into the Brotherhood encampment. They
were certainly surprised and, I think, taken aback as we pressed our assault home. Unfortunately, one of them
had the presence of mind to level a heavy weapon, with which he made short work of me!

I] came round screaming - not only had someone administered cyclazine, but in writhing as its effects hit me
I’d managed to stick my left hand into a large clump of some extremely potent stinging plants! It caused me
so much pain that I was unable to use the hand, awkward for a left-hander like me.... running RVC screen
repair sequences turned into a juggling act! Still, eventually we managed to get back to base more or less
unscathed, all our casualties retrieved and nobody suffering from more than overdoses of IR. One good bit of
news, one of the components for the uplink had been found in the Brotherhood camp, and had been brought
back. We were soon in our shelter units, worn out and well ready to sleep.

The morning began early, but peacefully. For once, Honer didn’t try to inspect us, even he realised that our
present situation is not conductive to spit and polish! As soon as we’d breakfasted, we were all called
together in the command tent. O’Shaunessy was scurrying round giving everybody injections. She insisted,
even when I asked why, considering they’d previously done so to counter high H/R levels on a planet
different from the one we were now on, and nobody had taken radiation readings here. All she’d say was that
they wouldn’t do us any harm. Apone looked, as usual, dubious!

Fluffy Bunny tried to summarise the position. We’d been a small team to start with, and were down by three,
with Emma Rell, Adder and Stryker dead. There was also some kind of allergy problem afflicting some
people. We had the aerial and the electronics for the uplink, but still needed a power pack. Apparently this
was what the O’Donnels were offering, but whether or not they’d turn up was open to question. Meanwhile,
we began to speculate on what was actually going on. Why did people intending to land on X244 crash land
here instead? Dibley voiced the suggestion that maybe, if some alien or ancient race had once lived on X244,
they’d left behind some kind of defence mechanism that caused the effect, whether by design or because it
had malfunctioned. Perhaps the original survey team - of whom we’ve had no signs - did get to the right
place and, through fiddling, turned it on! As for this place, X243, apparently there was at one time a secret
CMC research station here, so it must be possible to land here safely. However, it appears that the station
commander had gone to the bad, and perhaps had been in league with Nasco even before he’d been
discovered and chased out of the Corps. Our main objective had to be to get hold of the rest of the uplink
equipment and make contact with the Caravaglia. Then rescuing those who had crashed and wanted to leave
would become possible.

After the briefing, I was sent out on guard duty again. Before too long, the O’Donnels turned up again. As
well as saying that they were called Donald, Big Charles and Mack, they said that they’d return in two hours
with the power pack for the uplink, their price being a letter signed by Fluffy Bunny promising them passage
off planet. He agreed and they went off. Then Fluffy Bunny called me into his tent, and said that he was
going to send Calvin with a couple of others to deliver the letter and get the power pack, Oslo and most of
the others out on patrol and I, with Cardinal and Quark, was to be left to look after the base... and the bits of
the uplink that we already had!

Fortunately, all was quiet. Fluffy Bunny and O’Shaunessy used the time to catch up on their paperwork. At
one point, however, Fluffy Bunny came out, said “I’m borrowing Mexal “ and shot off into the forest.
Apparently he’d posted a couple of Marines as an observation post, and wanted to check up on them. That’s
what Apone had been moaning about the day before, that he’d gone out to check on whoever was out there
on his own without telling anyone. So this time he took me along as a bodyguard, saying that it would be
“rather embarrassing” if he was captured or killed! But the excursion passed off without incident. Once we
were back, Calvin returned with his power pack, and Oslo’s mob came back with a fellow who said that he
was a biochemist from the research station, and that there were a few survivors, living rough. He offered to
take us there.

Everybody got a drink and sorted themselves out, and then Fluffy Bunny decided that we’d all go together to
collect the survivors and bring them back to our base. He told me to act as his buddy as we set off, so I
followed him dutifully as we headed off through the forest yet again. As we advanced, screams rent the air
ahead. The biochemist made to run off in that direction, and - after trying to stop him - Fluffy Bunny directed
us to make haste that way ourselves. By the time I got there, the screams had died down. There were several
ragged humans, two dead Brothers and a live one with a knife wound in the shoulder, apparently inflicted by
Apone. It appears that the three Brothers had attacked the survivors and one - the stabbed one - had
attempted to molest a human female amongst the survivors. Or is she? Human, I mean - of all people, it
turned out to be Tane Diamond herself!

Once he’d been patched up, I was detailed to look after the Brother - mostly this involved defending him
from Diamond, who managed to kick him in a tender part of the anatomy before she could be hauled off!
When everything had been sorted out, we made our way back to our base, taking the survivors along with us.
Calvin insisted on relieving me of my weapon, as a security precaution considering that I was half-carrying
the Brother, supporting him as he lurched along. No doubt wise, but I wasn’t too happy going unarmed, there
were certainly other aggressors out there!

The Brother was surprisingly talkative. He told me that they’d been working for Nasco, and in general the
Brotherhood did a lot in association with him. He was scared that word would get back to Nasco that he’d
been talking to us, but still he kept on telling me things, something about funding being channelled through
some of the corporations, who used Nasco and the Brotherhood for some of the more dubious operations that
they had no intention of admitting any involvement in. He kept asking me if I was a “genetic”, so I tried to
tell him about CoedArian and how we had no idea of our origins although we appeared to predate the Parnell
experimentation on Lumiere. It seems he’d taken a liking to me, perhaps because I was being kind to him,
and he chattered on all the way back to our base, finally letting slip that the final connector necessary to get
the uplink working is in their base camp.

Back in our base, the survivors were given a medical check, and the Brother’s wound was properly treated.
The biochemist we’d found earlier came and asked me why I hadn’t been killed yet - I think this was some
reference to his belief that all Marines suffer from Nasco’s intolerance towards elves! We’d also recovered
more of the orange fruits and some vials of a red liquid, which I think was a poison but I’m not sure. They
said that the biochemist and Diamond had been making various drugs from local plants, which had provided
protection against radiation. At least, I think that’s what they said.

Anyway, in short order we were off again, to raid the Brotherhood’s main camp and get the last bit of the
uplink. The direction was totally different, through the forest, across open grassland then into another forest.
I was buddied with Zwalf again, and scurried along behind him as we made another two-wave assault. In the
camp, we found a tent full of assorted equipment, which Zwalf and I routed through even as the battle raged
- Fluffy Bunny’s orders had been that as soon as the missing component had been found we would leave.
Zwalf found the item, and shouted this out. Meanwhile, the Brothers had fought their way out of their camp,
but were firing on us from a distance. Quite a few people had already gone down, and just as Zwalf waved
the connector in triumph, my screen overloaded and everything went black.

When I opened my eyes, I was still in the Brotherhood camp, now secured by the Marines. O’Shaunessy and
Dibley were kneeling either side of me, arguing about their diminishing drug supply - which needless to say
I’d just made further inroads into, to the tune of eight units of resusitant this time. Once I was back on my
feet, I jomned Quark, Waylander and Apone, who were maintaining part of a perimeter defence whilst the
medics worked. Then we saw two armed figures moving in. Not sure who they were, no Brotherhood
scarves, but they refused to answer our challenges. Fluffy Bunny directed Waylander and I to approach them
and investigate. One stood still, the other began to circle round. I went after the circling one, Waylander
approached the one standing still. Then they opened fire... and before I knew it everything went black again.

I came round to more cyclazine. And no screen. O’Shaunessy, who’d been treating me, explained that there
wasn't time to do anything about it - it needed a new power cell and she’d already taken and used the spares I
carry - and Waylander gave me an MS-CIV screen he had. The rest were ready to move out by then, and we
made our best pace back to our base. Finding it under attack from a sniper, Apone, Quark and I were sent to
see if we could find and eliminate him. Apone put me on point, making some comment about my “good elf
vision”. Not that we found anyone.

Back there, and still coming under sporadic fire from the forest - lurking Brothers, I suppose - Fluffy Bunny,
with Calvin’s help, got the uplink operational and was soon in communication with the Caravaglia. They
said they’d send in a drop ship for us, and given the “hot extraction” situation, it would land for 30 seconds.
We moved out into the open, and Fluffy Bunny - who used to be a pilot - talked the drop ship down. The
pilot was having quite a lot of difficulty, clear air turbulence was throwing it about as he flew overhead,
flared out and came to rest on the ground. Someone had handed me a rifle, and I was providing a rearguard
as the rest made their way across to the drop ship and hurried up the ramp. Then Cardinal called for help, he
had one of the survivors from the research station who could barely walk. I took her other arm, and we
staggered over. The drop ship pilot was counting out the seconds, and Waylander came back out to assist.
Behind us, shots rang out, I turned back to fire a few rounds myself, then literally threw myself onto the drop
ship ramp, landing in a heap as it took off.

And so, here we are back in space, still in the Sirent Cing system. I think they are trying to figure out what’s
causing the crashes and the misdirection, using remote sensing. We are all enjoying the chance to rest
somewhere safe! It probably will not be long before we are sent out again, but that’s what it is all about in
the Immediate Response Battalion.

At least I am in one piece, although there is a worrying increase in people taking note of my differences. Not
as strong as a dislike, not overt prejudice... they just seem to be more aware of things like my ears, eyesight
and so on that mark me as something other than human. It’s probably just curiosity, and I certainly have no
complaints about the Marines, they are all extremely nice to me. Just as long as nobody decides that I’d
make a better research subject than a Marine!

I’ll write again as soon as I know what we’re doing next,

All my respects,

Mexal
