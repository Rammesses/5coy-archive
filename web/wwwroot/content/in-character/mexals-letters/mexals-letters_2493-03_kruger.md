John, 

Our Data Intercept just hit paydirt!

We’ve got a message from a Marine in 5-Coy, which she was sending home to her folks!!! And get this - it
details an entire mission, codes and all!!! Better yet, this one was on Kruger, so I think we ought to put out
some quiet feelers for more info.

If we set even three of four messages es of this value a month from the data-tap, we’re going to have paid for it in under a year - it's a goldmine!

Decrypt say this one was a gem tho’ - the keys just came out easily. The expect it to be MUCH harder to
extract data from an average packet tho’. I think we may want to increase their budget somewhat. Can we
free up some time on the Geneva Al for the project?

Tomas

The Reverend Elder Belzakath
High Forest Hall,
Coed'Arian.

March 17, 2493.
To Mexal,
Greetings.

A brief word to wish you every good fortune with the Colonial Marine Corps. As the first of our people
to serve with the armed forces of the United Worlds, your observations will be invaluable. The Elder Glayva
has expressed an interest, as has General Tassach, and we trust that you will report back on your experiences.

As you know, we have heard some disquieting rumours about the treatment of so-called minority or
“mutant” groups - unofficial, of course - within the United Worlds, and it will be of particular value to learn
of any prejudices you may encounter both within the Marines and from the populace at large. Whereas it is
of no matter what a person looks like, provided his behaviour is ethical, there are those who will take note of
appearance and background before they consider your competence.

I hope that this does not sound too alarming, but we felt it necessary to make some small mention - few
enough of our people have mixed with those of the United Worlds on other than the most formal and
diplomatic occasions until now. You are not alone, we shall be placing other selected individuals in several
United Worlds organisations, as well as sponsoring trading missions, but you are the first.

Good luck. Go and show them that we of CoedArian are ready, able and willing to play our full part
within the United Worlds.

My blessing rest upon you,

To: Reverend Elder Belzakath & my friends back home.
From: Marine Mexal, Kruger.
Date: 21-03-2493.

Greetings!

It has been a hectic few days, but at last I have a few moments peace and quiet whilst waiting for the drop
ship out of here to let you all know how I have been getting on.

It was quite late - full dark - when I reached the training base the CMC had set up in the remote area of
Kruger they’d been loaned by the local militia; and like any organisation, there was a fair state of chaos
while everybody got sorted out, kit issued and such like. I’m glad I had my own gear with me, all I had to
worry about was getting hold of a weapon and helmet. And an ID card - at this stage just a plain blue one
with “RM0022”" on it. Then they fed us, and spent the rest of the evening explaining a little of what was
going on.

As most of you will know, the United Worlds have prohibited the use of any projectile weapons at all.
Needless to say, other weapons have promptly been devised. The main one used by both UW personnel and
the various dissident factions we’re likely to encounter is a radiation weapon. Incapacitating radiation (IR)
for short, they call it. Weapons to project it come in all shapes and sizes, from a hand gun (what we all started
out with) to heavy weapons which project one hell of a lot! It’s pretty dangerous stuff, and acts directly on
the target’s central nervous system, causing unconsciousness and death quite rapidly. I regret to say that it
acts just as well on elves as it does on humans!

Given the dangerous nature of IR, they’ve had to design methods of protection as well. These aren’t quite as
good as the weapon systems, but consist of a screen generator which offers complete protection for a limited
amount of IR, and then fails in a somewhat catastrophic manner, dumping most of the IR absorbed into you,
and you end up out cold - and likely to die in about half an hour if you don’t get medical treatment. I haven’t
yet had a good look at the circuitry...the armourer chased me away when I got a screwdriver out!....but I am
sure that it could be improved. Maybe it could leak absorbed IR back into the environment rather than
merely store it, then the screen strength could regenerate over a period of time, and there could be less to
dump onto the hapless wearer if the screen does fail entirely. I’ll have to think about this once I’ve had a
_ good poke around inside the thing.

Once they’d explained this, they told us a bit about the medical treatment of IR injury. They have some quite
efficient diagnostic tools, which can both regenerate the screens and analyse the precise damage suffered by
the wearer. They even tell you the level of resuscitation required, this is by various drugs. The basic training
covers what they call Med-Tech-4 level, which is a sort of field first-aider, but you can continue right up to
Surgeon levels if that is your particular interest. Not really mine, but I hope to get a chance to study at least
some of it, the usual elven characteristic of gathering any knowledge available! Naturally, a Med-Tech-4 is
quite limited in what he can do, but there are more powerful drugs available to the better qualified medics.

By then it was getting late and we all settled down to sleep. Some of the experienced Marines were busy
telling us tales about past missions, and a few were trying to wind me up - it seems that I’m the only elf on
the strength at the moment. The last one, who was a surgeon, went missing under rather mysterious
circumstances and has not been seen since. This is unusual, the CMC go to great lengths to recover missing
personnel (or their corpses) whenever they can.

The next morning everyone was up early. (I was already sitting under a tree - they made us sleep indoors so I
was glad to be up and out again!) After breakfast (and some of these marines eat like ents!) they began by
splitting the recruits up into 8-man squads. I ended up in 3 section. Then we had to pair up with a “buddy”, I
got landed with someone called Chaos, an Earth-born human. I don’t think that was his real name, most
people seemed to be going under an alias of some sort. The “buddy-pairs” are supposed to stay together at all
times, always know where the other is, and are responsible for each other, particularly if one is injured.

The first part of the training was an exercise aptly named “The Killing Field”. For this, all weapons and
screens were set to a training mode using some other form of non-lethal radiation. Just as well, only one of
the 22 recruits “survived”. Not me - having been told not to give the others any advice (I got quite a lot of
hassle over my prior military experience all through the training!), I had settled down in concealment and
was providing sniper cover for the rest of the squad. Eventually the instructors decided that I was causing too
much trouble and sent 3 of them against me. Two pinned me down by firing from 90 degrees apart and a
third sneaked up behind and picked me off. Then they had little difficulty in finishing off the rest of the
Squad.

After that little introduction - designed to show us how much we had to learn! - they got on with the actual
training. Not a lot new here, general basics of field craft, fire and movement, hand signals and so on. The
training in pyrotechnics was quite fun, especially as nobody had told the sergeant in charge of it that I had
any prior knowledge. He was quite surprised when I could easily spot his demonstration trip-wire, and so
when he took us for a walk through the nearby woods where he’d set some booby-traps he made me go
point. Then he was even more disgusted when I not only spotted his first trap but also disarmed it (which he
hadn’t shown us how to do)! Needless to say, they keep putting me on point now.

By late morning, we’d gone on to a big field beyond the woods to practise moving in formations. While
down there, we spotted some of the experienced Marines lurking at the edge of the woods, so when we
returned on the way back to lunch we weren't too surprised that they ambushed us. We gave about as good as
we got - and I managed to shoot the Commanding Officer (not something you get to do very often!).

That’s when things began to go a bit wrong. We’d just fended off the Marines when some others came in -
only they were live-firing. Fortunately, training-mode screens are effective against IR, but we had to get out
fast! When we got back to our base, we were told that the aggressors were members of The Brotherhood, a
bunch of anarchists who have a particular dislike for Marines. The rest of the training that day was carried
out with all weapons and screens set live, and with sentries posted. It certainly gave an edge to practising
how to take cover.

In the evening, we settled down in the base hut - which had a building screen which provided reasonable
protection as long as the door was shut - and posted a defensive perimeter. I was happily settled behind a tree
near the command tent, and could hear a transmission coming in. I pricked up my ears, it sounded like we
were going to get a live mission. Sure enough, not long afterwards, we were all called into the tent (quite a
squash!) to see a recording of the transmission in which a particularly youthful-looking general explained
that a satellite had re-entered in our vicinity, possibly due to sabotage, and that as we were the only Marines
in the area we had to go and get it back. Apparently there was something vitally secret about it, and it must
not fall into the hands of The Brotherhood or anyone else. What was worse was that it had both a nuclear
self-destruct and anti-tampering mechanisms, which would make retrieval difficult. For security reasons, the
cancel code for the self-destruct was sent to us in code, which we had to break before we could make use of
it. And we had something under two hours to crack the code and travel about two kilometres to where it had
landed. Seeing as the nuclear device had a blast radius of 10 K, we had some incentive to get there!

So back to the base hut and all hands turned to trying to decode the message. It was a four-digit code, and
each digit was found by solving a puzzle. One was based on 7-segment displays, you had to pick the next
one in the sequence, which had everyone confused until it was realised that it depended on the number of
internal right-angles, not what was being displayed at all! Then there was a numerical sequence, which went
7, 41, 12, 82,...and was simply the 7 times table with the digits transposed. The next one was a geometrical
design from which you had to work out the total number of triangles present and finally there was a circle
with numbers and one missing. That kept us all quite busy for a while.

When the decoding was finished, we all got ready to set out. Only the command group knew all the details of
the defusing that had to be done, so if anyone else got captured they couldn’t say very much. I did make sure
I knew the code to turn off the self-destruct, however, if time was critical I wanted to be able to make sure it
wouldn’t go bang in my face! They split up the experienced Marines, putting a few with each section, also
some of the few medics around. One stayed back in the base camp to receive incoming casualties.

All ready, we set out. First of all 1 Section, then 2 Section, then the command group, which was the
Commanding Officer and a few experienced Marines including the pyro expert, then us of 3 Section bringing
up the rear. We got through the woods without incident (but several false alarms) and finally reached an area
which looked like an airless moon - at least as far as we could see in the dark. There wasn’t even enough for
my elf-vision to pick up on. Here we split up to advance on the satellite landing site from all sides, it was
somewhere in the middle of this featureless wasteland.

As we went along our assigned route, we heard several explosions in other areas. The Brotherhood had set
up quite a few trip wires. Just then my screen went on the blink and it took a frantic few minutes to get it
working again. As well nobody was shooting at us! Our route was along the left margin of the area, and we
found a couple of trip wires which we crawled under. Unfortunately, someone behind me failed to avoid the
wire and set one off - the flare totally blinded me, and I groped my way for about half the distance to the
satellite before my vision came back in. That’s the trouble with elven eyesight - it’s a lot better than humans
in the dark but it is more sensitive to disruption as well. Fortunately, Chaos came to the rescue and led me
along, warning me about the various ditches and holes in our way.

Eventually we reached the site where the satellite had landed. The Brotherhood were around, and firing on
us, but hadn’t approached it. We lot made a defensive perimeter about it while the command team, minus the
Commanding Officer who had been laid out by one of the booby traps and left to be collected on the way
back, settled down to stop the self-destruct and disarm the anti-tamper devices so we could take the thing
back to base. I was quite close, and got rather worried when I heard someone saying that they couldn’t
remember the code - so I called it out to them. (I wonder how long it will be before I forget “1434"?) Later
on, when we got back, they told us that the self-destruct had been switched off with a mere 15 seconds left
on the clock! I’m glad I didn’t know that at the time.

Just then we came under quite heavy fire from several directions, and so extended the perimeter to give the
technicians space to sort out the satellite and get it ready to be moved. I took several hits, which you know
about because the sensors in the screen system go wild and make a tremendous racket - all the time it’s on
you have this constant “bleep-bleep-bleep”, and the more hits you take the faster the bleeping gets. Anyway,
by now my sensors were going wild, and finally gave up the ghost with a sort of squeal. The screen went
down, and after a brief flare of pain I passed out.

I don’t know how long I was out for, it can’t have been long because battle still seemed to be raging
overhead. I came round writhing in pain and being held down by one of the medics and someone else, who
had hold of my feet. I later learned that they’d bypassed the normal resuscitation methods and administered
some drug that basically kick-starts your central nervous system. Whatever, it hurt and it tasted terrible! No
matter, better than being dead. They found another screen for me, mine was quite defunct and they didn’t
have time to repair it then and there.

Soon, the firing died down a bit, and what was left of Section 3 was sent out to sweep the area to make sure
that no casualties had been left behind. My buddy Chaos was still around, it turned out that he’d stayed by
me while I was out cold, calling for a medic until one came - exactly what the whole buddy system is about.
We searched the area thoroughly, but didn’t find anyone there. Meanwhile, the techs had managed to make
the satellite safe, and so we all made our way back to base, in whatever order we could manage.

When we got back, we found that most people had survived, but that the Commanding Officer and one other
Marine, called Sparky I think, were still missing, and were believed captured by The Brotherhood. We
settled down for an uneasy night, after a hot drink. More tales were swapped, and I spent some time talking
with one fellow called Cyberknight, who is one of the few cyborgs in the CMC. Taught him a dirty song, and
he told me a few tales too.

Next morning was pretty chaotic. The Brotherhood mounted a concerted attack on the base camp, and at one
point had us more or less trapped inside the main building with snipers covering the doors. The medics were
working flat out, so were the armourers repairing screens. Everyone was in and out, taking turns on guard,
fetching back the wounded and so on.

Eventually things quietened down a bit, but then The Brotherhood dumped something and ran off. This
turned out to be the remains of Sparky, which they had booby-trapped. Cyberknight attempted to defuse the
trap, but only succeeded in blowing himself up. He survived, but is going to need some more rebuilding.
They’d also attached a note to the body, which confirmed that they had got the Commanding Officer and
invited us to a meeting. They wanted to exchange him for the satellite. It was only then that I discovered that
we weren’t really supposed to be on Kruger at all, and that a captured Marine, dead or alive, would be pretty
embarrassing to the Corps; apart from the tradition of always getting our men back.

A plan was hatched, whereby we’d go to the meeting in force, encircle the place and do our best to get the
Commanding Officer back without parting with the satellite. A bag was to be taken along, which we’d tell
them contained it but didn’t, it had been safely hidden and nobody was saying where.

This time 3 Section went out first, with me on point. Sometimes I wonder if elven senses are totally a
blessing! The command group followed, and the other two sections circled round to engage the meeting
point from all sides. We reached the place without incident, crossing a wide open field in extended line
towards a knoll where we could see some of The Brotherhood lurking. Eventually a couple came out and
told us to halt, and of course we came a bit closer before stopping. I was on the end of the line nearest to the
knoll, and deliberately drifting wider, ready to make a move round to its rear when the moment to fight
came. The parley seemed to go on for ages. I could see some of the other Marines coming over the brow of
the hill behind the enemy position, fortunately it took a long time before they noticed.

When they did notice, all hell broke loose. We charged straight in. I think one of The Brotherhood had a
heavy weapon targeted on me, because my sensors registered five shots in about as many seconds, and were
bleeping like fury. I thought my time had come, that screen could not withstand another hit, but to my
amazement I took no more throughout about twenty minutes’ fighting! Chaos, an experienced Marine and I
were ferreting around the back of the knoll, taking out several members of The Brotherhood and finally
chasing the last two off - to my disappointment we were called back from chasing them to set up a defensive
perimeter around the knoll whilst the medics got to work. The Commanding Officer was there, but in a bad
way.

Once the medics had finished, we began to make an orderly retreat back to base. Chaos and I were about the
last to leave, as we were guarding the direction in which the last few Brotherhood members had been seen to
go. Then we were put on point leading the group half-carrying the Commanding Officer back. Somewhere in
the middle of the woods we heard that the remainder of The Brotherhood were attacking the base and those
Marines who had already reached it. We waited where we were until all was clear, and then moved in. The
Brotherhood hadn’t managed to penetrate the base, or get near the satellite, and we had retrieved the
Commanding Officer, so the mission had a successful conclusion.

That’s about it, really. Now that everything was quiet, there was a parade and all us recruits - except one
who’d died during the final assault - were passed out as fully-qualified Marines, and the Commanding
Officer went on about how glad he was to be back with us and the usual sort of thing about joining a unit
with a glorious tradition - at this point one of the sergeants had a fit of the giggles when I caught his eye,
because I’d predicted the Commanding Officer would say exactly that! - then they said that a drop ship
would be along soon to take us all out of here.

Well, there you are. The first few days. Ill write again once I know what’s happening next. So far, apart from
a bit of teasing and ear-pulling there hasn’t been any racial problem, but I have heard rumours that there’s a
bunch called Purity or some such who would like to keep the Corps strictly human and want to ban us elves,
cyborgs and any other non-humans. Their problem, I guess. If the Corps is willing to let me enlist, I don’t see
why I should worry about their prejudices. I'll just get on with doing my job.

Respects to all,
Mexal
