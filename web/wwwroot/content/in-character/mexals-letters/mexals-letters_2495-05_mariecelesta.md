John,

From the latest of Marine Mexal’s letters home, the A-23 project came very close to trouble. How did that
Marine transport, the Garavaglia, just happen upon her?

I argued against using the MC at the time, but was overruled. What I want to know is where the hell has she
been all this time?

Mexal’s comment about all the crew and passengers being insane from IR or HR is wrong, according to the
A-23 administrator. They are certain that massive jump-trauma is the cause. This in itself would be a result,
as it means that the A-23 modifications to the MC have increased the available jump-drive power
significantly over “our competitor’s" best efforts.

It appears that Arnold and Housonens survived with the Marines in the EEV when the ship overjumped. I’ve
put into action an emergency retrieval for priority expedite, but think we could use Takashima’s team on
standby aboard the Nayo Maru just in case. I’ve flashed them coordinates, but need your authorisation.

If we can’t retrieve them, I know you above all realise that they must be silenced - permanently. Takashima
has the codes for their cortex bombs already.

We may also need to obtain Mexal and ask her some questions. From her letter, it seems she was
fooling with what computer systems were available for most of the time the Marines were aboard. If she
managed to recover any system logs or black-box data, then we MUST have it, even if we have to arrange an
accident for her.

As soon as we get some answers, you, I and 1 will have to decide on the future of the project. So far as it
goes, if the latest test data is anything to go by we have a unique device here. But we HAVE to get
Housonens and Arnold out if we can. If they talk, either to the Marines, or worse, “our competitor" gets hold
of them...

Tomas

##### Message Text Begins

To: The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From: TechSgt. Mexal, aboard the Garavaglia.
Date: 29-05-2495.

Greetings!

I have some bizarre events to tell you about this time. Last time I wrote was just after our visit to
Groombridge, when I’d ended up in the isolab being treated for severe radiation poisoning. They eventually
let me out a couple of days ago, saying that I’d still be somewhat weak and prone to tire easily. Still, the
Garavaglia had just completed her latest refit, and was returning to CMC HQ and, although they hadn’t
stocked her fully, they allowed some of us - the rest of the company had been sent on leave - to hitch a ride.
They

Oslo was the only officer present, and he insisted on setting up a squad structure and running some training.
Some people moaned that they were still on leave, but I didn’t mind. Training served to pass the time - even
watching the external views of the ship on the monitors was entertaining! We did not even have much to
read, there’d been some problem at the Interstella offices and we had all of one copy between the lot of us.
An account of events on Groombridge, some comments from and about those who did not survive, and a
long letter from Chaos, who must have been suffering some mental aberrations.... a string of lies and false
accusations. Some wild comments about the trip to Juliette, saying that all their accusations are true, and that
Apone, O’Shaunessy and I were responsible for torturing prisoners! (Talking about that, I’ve heard a rumour
that the Juliette global TV network has produced a documentary/film of the incident, with one of their
leading soap stars playing the person with the pointy ears!) At least we had copies of In the Line of Fire,
which seems to be getting better and better.

We had a couple of new sergeants posted in as replacements for those poor people who died on Groombridge
(who have all been awarded the Gold Cross, by the way). These were Sergeant B’Stard, who served as
Oslo’s 2 i/c, and Sergeant Trader. There was also a human female MFC called Havoc and a male called
Jarvis. Welcome returns were Wellesley (now back in his right mind, I’m glad to say) and both Quark and
Cybil Shepherd, neither of whom have been with us for a while. Despite my protests that I’m a technical
sergeant, not a field commander, Oslo insisted on giving me a squad - pointing out that as we weren’t on
active service, it didn’t really matter! I had Dibley, Quark and Wellesley. That was Delta; Alpha was
Corporal Beck, with Sabre, Silver and Havoc; Bravo consisted of Martins, Sadperson, Schwartzkopf, Cassel
and Jarvis; and Charlie was Trader, Rocktansky, Krinly, $.C. Ratch and Cybil Shepherd.

Anyway, we set off on Friday evening, made the first jump before bedtime. Next morning, Oslo called for a
parade. Moans all round. All he had to say was that Maxwell Rocktansky has been promoted to MFC, and is
acting Corporal; $.C. Ratch is also an acting Corporal, and B’Stard is promoted to Officer Cadet. Then he
said that we’d spend the morning doing tactical discussions - the old Tactical What-ifs game. He issued a
sheet of questions to the squad commanders (and was good enough to run through it quickly with me to
make sure I was happy with what was wanted!).

The next hour or so passed quite quickly. By then, we were back in jump, and when we'd finished the
discussion and were left to our own devices I settled down for a rest beside the external monitor screen - I
find the weird patterns you get in jumpspace quite restful to watch! I think I nodded off, but was woken by
the transition back to realspace, no matter how many times you make a jump transition, you feel it! Jf
Abnormal rotation of molecules in directions not intended. Well, I always know about it - the others don’t let
on, but I guess they do.

Anyway, dropped out into realspace for the next navigational check, and all the proximity alarms went off at
once. We could hear the chatter from the bridge, something about what looked like a Type 3 freighter just
sitting dead in space. Her transponder gave name and registry number - SS Marie Celesta CSR 614023-9 -
but she wasn’t responding to any hails. The bridge crew started scanning, and sent a drone camera to have a
look. Kindly, they relayed the pictures over the monitor, so we had a good view. Big thing, three large fusion

Then the intercom rang. I answered it, a voice said "Who is that?". "TechSgt Mexal" I replied. "This is
Captain Jacques, I want to speak to Lieutenant Oslo." I called him over. When he’d finished, he turned to the
rest of us, and told us that scans had revealed lifesigns, but they were still not responding to the radio. So
they wanted us to form a boarding party and go take a look, assess the situation, perhaps rescue those aboard
as the ship did not look like it was in a fit state to go anywhere by itself. Their anti-meteor system was
offline, so the Garavaglia would be able to approach close enough to rig an umbilical across to one of the
airlocks - we didn’t have any dropships aboard. Nor did we have much else, but the crew were rounding up
what supplies they did have: a 24 hour ration pack each, standard CMC sidearms and screens, and that was
about it. They also had a couple of computer bypass units, to crack doorlocks. Then we were told that there
they’d detected some kind of passive security system which appeared to pick up any kind of electrical
activity. So they’d decided that we should use chemical light sticks rather than torches - from what they
could tell most of the internal power was offline and the place would likely be dark. Radios were also
banned. The rest of the information was also bad - one cargo hold was open to space, and there were other
areas either unpressurised or contaminated with hard radiation... or both!

As usual, all the kit was passed to me. I enlisted Quark’s assistance to issue weapons and screens, and gave
one of the bypass units to Rocktansky, keeping the other one myself. Oslo was busy handing out the light
Sticks, someone else began distributing the rat packs. Then the intercom rang again. Everybody looked at
me, so I answered it, and a voice said that Captain Jacques wanted to talk to Oslo again, so I passed the
handset over. When he finished, he told us that the umbilical was in place and pressurised, and we were to
move out in five minutes. They’d rigged a fibre optic line, so we would be able to communicate with them
without setting off the security sensors.

All too soon we were trooping off, via the turbolift up to the airlock where the umbilical tube across was
anchored. Across - never feels safe, whatever the Navy might say! - and into the airlock on the Marie
Celesta. Charlie squad went first, then Oslo and B’Stard, then us in Delta - "We want the tech near the front
but not at it" - then Alpha, with Bravo bringing up the rear. The lock cycled, and I was called forwards to run
a bypass on the inner door’s controls. The keypad was dead, but after an initial struggle to get the hang of it,
I ran a bypass successfully. While I was working, Oslo got everybody else organised and ready to go
through, and we could hear screams somewhere beyond the door.

Inside, all was dark. Rumbling engine noises, which went on virtually continuously all the time we were
there, echoing around the place. The first person in called a warning about bodies on the floor, a few light
Sticks were set going, then a very bright strobe light started flashing. Most of the Marines were stumbling
around, but there was plenty of light for me, although I found the strobe troublesome. Looked round, several
doors and a lift shaft upwards. Comms panels on the wall, all dark. Fiddled with one, no obvious sign of
damage, took the front plate off but the circuitry looked all right - seemed the computer net was down.

The bodies, according to those who looked, had been hacked to death. No ID, generally nothing at all on
them. There was a plan of the ship on one wall, we’d come in on the port side near the stern and about
half-way up. It didn’t show much of use. Some people went up in the lift, sounds of firing were heard.
Others were poking around where we were. I was kept busy getting doors open. Then someone handed me
an electronic datapad they’d found on one of the bodies. I had great difficulty in getting into a corner away
from everybody else to try it out - not sure just how sensitive the security system was (although as it was
ignoring the bypass devices, a datapad would probably be all right). Not that it was much help - didn’t seem
to have anything in it at all, not that I could find anyway.

Then I was called away to go up to the next deck - some of the people up there had gone through a door
which had closed behind them. Ran a bypass, but the actual mechanism was faulty, it only opened a little
way then closed again. Fortunately, it continued to do this, so I managed to get a metal spike in, then levered
it open by brute force, despite shouts from someone - not sure who - warning me not to get any part of my
anatomy caught in it! Two or three of us went through, found the others, took some fire from I think the next J
deck up, then that door managed to close again. Couldn’t manage to initialise a link between the access
control and the bypass unit, and we had to wait for Rocktansky to run a bypass from the other side. This
time, the door only opened a little way and we had to squeeze through. I was last, there wasn’t really enough
room and I was wondering if I’d have to remove my belt kit, then Martins grabbed my arm and tugged hard.
Ouch, but through.

Back downstairs, Oslo wanted to know if I could open the airlock door back to the umbilical, but the access
controls refused to cooperate. The fibre optic voice link was fine, fortunately. A few civilians turned up, they
kept asking about their dinner, apparently passengers, but all acting rather strange. Then I was called to open
another door, and instead of the empty spaces so far discovered, this one was a bit more interesting. Some
screens on the wall, a desk with a computer terminal on it, another table with a metal case on the floor beside
it. Several Marines scouted the room, no occupants, then I was told to check out the items in there. Usual
procedure, told the rest of them to clear out and watch from the doorway, gave running description to Quark
(who’s expressed an interest in learning EOD) as I began by giving the box a visual check, then lifted it up
onto the table and opened it - turning it so that it opened away from me, of course. Nothing untoward, it was
in fact a good set of maintenance tools.

Looked round a bit more. Screens on the wall, looked like security scans, although they weren’t showing
much. One bigger one with a picture frozen on it - looked like an external view of the Maria Celesta with
another ship in the distance, plus what appeared to be a boarding craft of some sort along side. A gas giant
was in the background. Oslo came in and started looking at it, speculating that it was perhaps a pirate attack
on the ship - maybe that was the cause of all the carnage. Meanwhile I had a look at the computer terminal.
Rather surprisingly, it had power, and I soon had it on - but it demanded a start-up disk. A strange woman
came in - small pointy ears - and wandered around singing. Then she wandered out again. I sent the other
Marines to look for disks. The first three they brought me were games - not particularly good ones - then I
was told that another computer had been found on the next deck up (through that temperamental door, which
was now fully open and staying that way).

I went up there, and as I got there someone handed me a disk which was labelled "Computer Network
Start-up Disk". Put that in, got the thing going. Various items came up as the network came online - some
messages that audio, visual and thermal sensors had failed, then a sidebar menu showing various options -
PMFT, COMMS, CMFT, something else I never got to go. Tried the comms first, it was an internal email
system, but although it gave no error messages it didn’t go properly. PMFT turned out to be the passenger
manifest, but calling that up resulted in a message saying that the file was corrupt and the backup should be
used. Trying CMFT got a message that the cargo supernumerary terminal was failing to connect to the
network.... hmmm, think that was the terminal on the deck below.

A smallish bloke then came in, looking very worried. He said he’d lost his dog, a "poodle" he called it,
which had run off. He thought it had hidden in a ventilation duct. I asked if it was any good at scavenging
for itself, he said he was worried that someone might have scavenged it!

Then someone came along, said he’d found a hard disk - loose one. Perhaps the cargo supernumerary
computer’s - so I went back down and opened up the box, found that there was one already. Fortunately, just
after I’d replaced the casing, someone came in with a couple of disks labelled cargo supernumerary, and
Krinly got that going - got the cargo manifest up on screen. Looking through, all manner of things: medical
supplies, fertiliser, ore (processed and unprocessed), agricultural machinery, vid-slugs.... and the very last
entry was "livestock", the notes section of the record read "8 convicts in coldsleep". The interesting thing
was the destination codes, all over the place. Ship must have been a tramp freighter.

Then I was called back up a deck, into the room next to the one I’d been in before, to yet another terminal. A
fellow in coveralls was playing some kind of space invaders game, didn’t really want to stop, but told me
that he was the ship’s plumber. On the desk beside him, I noticed amongst other things a swipe card. While
his attention was on his game, I managed to pocket it without him noticing. Eventually he finished his game
and was persuaded to go away. I settled down, he started asking if anyone had seen his access card, but
eventually wandered off. Label on the keyboard "Marie Celesta Information System: Engineering Support:
Node ID 19-0346". Bit more interesting. Used the startup disk, got the thing going..... a synthesised voice
said "System online", then both onscreen messages and the voice reported "Proximity alert", messages about
the mass detection system going active, then the thrusters fired. Oops - sent someone down to check on the
links to the Garavaglia. The jolt had disconnected the umbilical, but the fibre optic had survived.... for once
the Navy had had enough sense to put a free-reel cable in!

Started looking around the system. A sidebar menu with various items: AUXS, ENVS, FLTC, JDS, JSEM,
NAVG, POWR and TRSC. Unfortunately, I decided to look at NAVG, maybe find out where the ship had
come from and was going to. A whole raft of messages shot up the screen - something about corruption
detected in the jump system, reloading it from backup..... then the Jump Drive System came online, a set of
coordinates were entered in and it started making the synchronisation calculations to make the jump! Eeek. I
don’t know much about navigation, but the coordinates looked a long way off - X:345.234, Y:979.435,
Z:963.363 if I remember them rightly - and the destination was apparently 625 light years away. Worse, the
DF was set at 0.86 - far too high. Even if the ship had been in a fit state to make a jump, that would kill us.
Oslo had been lurking around, and scuttled off to inform the Garavaglia.... as soon as he said the jump drive
had initialised they said that they would move away so as to avoid the fringes of the mass transformation if it
did fire up.

A bit of poking around discovered a way to change the coordinates and DF setting, so I asked for some
sensible coordinates from the Garavaglia’s navigators.... if I couldn’t stop it, and the ship didn’t just fall
apart, maybe we could at least be heading somewhere sensible. Beck came back with some fresh
coordinates, X:721.302, Y:831.610, Z:003.572, and I entered them. Then to my consternation got "Security
override: Changes locked out”. I regret I swore, rather loudly!

I explored the rest of the system - the AUXS was a selection of information screens on the status of various
auxiliary systems (airlocks, EEVs, cargo bay systems, umbilicus and running lights), although I don’t think
that all of it was reporting accurately and no changes could be made; ENVS and FLTC failed to open at all
(FLTC put up a message about "Command Processor:" but that’>s all, no way to make use of it); JDS was
the jump drive system; JSEM returned a message that the JSE Monitor program was corrupt; POWR showed
the status of the various engines - auxiliary power online; port, starboard and centreline main engines offline;
jump and RCS thrusters on standby and the power distribution system online (once it had re-routed itself
around some problems it found). Finally the TRSC was the thrusters, which it claimed were disabled.

Every so often, a voice updated the jump time, "JSE synch completion in N hours X minutes"... very strange
these times were, to begin with it got longer and longer. Perhaps the system was rejecting the ridiculous
figures the automatic sequence had inserted. Unfortunately, after many hours - not sure just how long, it
reversed this trend and rapidly approached completion time.

Meanwhile, the others were having their troubles too. Various people, many either aggressive or crazy (or
both), who either shot at them or got in the way. A security robot turned up several times, which reacted to
hostile actions, movement and noise. I came face to face with it once, stood motionless for what seemed an
eternity until it moved away again. There were several people in coveralls, apparently what was left of the
crew of the ship - most of them were little help, refused to do anything, said that they had no means of
reaching the bridge from here, could not act without authorisation and so on. Other folk were what was left
of the passengers, who to a man were mad. One came in, said that his name was Robert but Slug to his
friends, and said that he’d been sunbathing. All he wanted to know was could we get the showers and the
sauna working for him.

Someone else - fortunately I never met him - caused a lot more trouble. Called himself Tech, he’d
established some kind of harem, and also had cornered a stock of medical supplies. He fought with the
Marines several times, on one occasion kidnapped Cybil Shepherd and assaulted her, then attempted to trade
- some of his women had taken refuge with the Marines and he wanted them back in exchange for medical
supplies (our own, low to begin with, had virtually run out). When Oslo did not want to negotiate, he tried
switching off the internal temperature control and air circulation systems. Eventually he was defeated, the
internal systems came back on line, and the medics were delighted to have further drug supplies.

I’m not sure of everything that went on, I spent most of the time on one or other of the computers - mainly
the engineering one - trying to figure out a way of stopping it. There wasn’t a chair in the room, I took one of
the desk drawers out and perched on that. I heard frequent firing, occasionally a few stray shots came my
way. Most of the time I was able to reset my screen again (or someone else did it for me - Dibley in
particular was always coming through to check up on me), but occasionally the fighting came too close for
comfort when I was absorbed in trying something, and the next thing I’d know I was on the floor with one of
the medics fussing around. The first time, someone had heard a yelp and came in to find me sprawled on my
back, they’d yelled for Silver who had come and dealt with me.

The second time this happened, I woke up in the room where the other computer was, next to the engineering
one, being held down by Dibley and S.C. Ratch, who’d given me cyclazine. Then someone came along with
a disk containing the passenger manifest backup, and I managed to get that going, although there was a lot of
corruption in the file. I had a quick scan through - wasn’t too happy at finding the name D.E. Nasco (not
THAT Nasco I hoped, but we never did find out!), but more interested in a computer design engineer, two
members of the CMC listed as “escorts” and a senior member of Haoins-Worthy Starways, who were the
owners of the Marie Celesta. Perhaps she’d have the override codes to enable me to get into the system.
Then I called Oslo and left him looking through the list, going back to the engineering computer.

At one point, Oslo came in and asked if I’d eaten anything. I had no idea when I'd last had something, but he
organised someone - Quark I think - to sort out something. He came back later with a plate, but whatever
he’d made was foul, and I only ate a couple of mouthfuls. Anyway, I had my mind on other things, trying to
find a way of persuading the system not to make any kind of jump, or even to attempt something a bit more
sensible than what it was planning. Quark made a comment about it being typical of a techie to let her dinner
get cold.

Two men came in, armed with big sticks, and said that they were hunting rabbits. No idea why they thought
they’d find any, but they didn’t seem to be willing to accept my assurance that there were none there, and
wanted to search the place. I was glad I had a helmet on - the large pointy ears might have given them the
wrong idea!

Later, I was asked to go to the deck above and run bypasses on the doors, while Trader directed a search
team. He was extremely protective, and always made sure that I was out of the way before they entered any
room - by now I didn’t even have a weapon, while I’d been working on the computers Cybil had borrowed it,
as hers had been stolen when she’d been captured. However, it wasn’t until much later that I discovered that
the whole area was fairly radioactive! Just as well I didn’t stay up there too long.

I went back to the engineering computer, for more fruitless efforts with it. People kept wandering in and out -
in the dim light I could barely see that anybody was there, let alone who it was, the brighter light of the
computer screen was blinding me to anything else. Just as well none of the bad guys came in - what with no
weapon and not being able to make out who was there I wouldn’t have had a chance!

One visitor, several times, was some kind of cleric called Father Jeffries, in a long white robe. He said that he
spent his time going around the passengers, bringing them food and comfort, and he was quite happy to ask
around to see if there was anyone who could help with the computer system. He wouldn’t take me with him,
he said that some areas were under the control of hostile people who allowed him to pass but not anyone
else. The design engineer turned up - with his wife in tow - and had a look at the system, but said that there
was nothing he could do. A smallish female came in two or three times, she was one of Tech’s harem, and
called herself "28" - she said that if anyone tampered with the jump coordinates it would just make a jump
immediately. She puzzled me even more when I found the system date and time - which thought that it was
28-08-2494.... she could not understand why I was puzzled because she thought that that was correct!

Then Rocktansky came scampering in, shouting something about being chased by the security robot, and
climbed under the desk into the kneehole. I’d been using that as a bolthole, and he said "Put your head
between my legs" - then assured me that he was perfectly serious, he reckoned we both could get under
there, just about. Fortunately, nobody saw us! He went away, but some time later, after an expedition to a
lower deck was back even faster and back under the desk. The robot was this time close on his heels, and
before I had time to react it opened fire on me with a heavy weapon, with the inevitable results. I opened my
eyes to Dibley, who was complaining and said "Whenever you hear firing, take cover, and that’s a medical
order I’m giving you!”.

All very well, but some time later I was distracted and didn’t notice firing, next thing I knew my screen had
overloaded and I passed out. When I opened my eyes again, Martins was there, with some garbled story
about how he’d come and found me on the floor, reset my screen and was just working out what resusitants I
needed when some hostiles came in, disarmed him and chased him away. Last he’d seen, a couple of them
had been moving me into a corner and searching me - he thought they were looking for weapons. When
they’d left the room, Rocktansky had managed to sneak up behind them, shot one and knifed another, and
retrieved Martins’ sidearm. Then Martins had come back to continue treating me. Dibley came in and told
me off again.

That’s when the jump synch really began to get going, the voice reports became more frequent and the time
to completion was dropping fast. Oslo came in with one of the ship’s engineers, who had been taken prisoner
and was under guard. He said that this fellow was to give me his computer codes, but was under no
circumstances to be allowed to touch the computer. He wasn’t too happy, struggled with his guards a bit, but
eventually said that his ID was Tech-232. I called up the security access login, put that in and it promptly
asked for a password. The fellow, whose name was E.K. Arnold, the technical systems engineer for the
Marie Celesta, refused.

Then a woman was led in - the one who’d been wandering around singing when I’d been looking at the cargo
supernumerary ’s computer on the deck below. She wasn’t singing now, and it turned out that she was called
Housonens, and was the Haoins-Worthy Starways executive on the passenger manifest. She instructed him to
give his password, and eventually, reluctantly, he did: AJB232. Something seemed to happen, a few
messages came up on the screen, something about the collision avoidance system going offline. I sent Beck
to report this to the Garavaglia, maybe they could manoeuvre closer now, maybe rig some way of getting us_ ff
off. Then I called up the Jump Drive System screen and made yet another attempt to change the jump
coordinates, but got nowhere. Still all changes locked out.

I then got Housonens to enter her access codes, but this had the same total lack of results.... and by now the
synthesised voice was not only saying "JSE synch completion in one five minutes", there had also been an
announcement, heard all over the ship, about preparing for jump transition. Oslo came in again, said that
they’d found all of one working EEV and we’d make good our escape in it. Not sure how they got in, I think
one of the swipe cards did the trick. We moved out, then came under fire. Trader rushed off firing in return,
then I stumbled over Oslo who must have been hit, he was lying unconscious. I picked him up and got into
an already crowded EEV, finding myself next to Housonens. The jump countdown was reaching its final
minute by now, so the EEV was launched without further delay. And only just in time, we had barely cleared
the Marie Celesta before it blew up.

We reached the Garavaglia safely, and took stock. There were twenty of us crammed into an EEV rated for
twelve..... but Trader, S.C. Ratch and Jarvis were missing. There is no way any of them could have survived.
I feel terrible, it is as if it is all my doing. It’s quite obvious that someone had set up the computer system :
with bizarre coordinates, a deliberate attempt - which succeeded - to destroy the ship, but I was the one who
got the computers online. Seemed obvious at the time, best way to find out what’s happening.

Not that we really know that much. There are some indications of a pirate attack - the external damage, the
security scan picture. Perhaps some of the convicts escaped, or were released, from cold sleep. It was
interesting that all the running lights of the ship had been turned off apart from the shuttle landing pad lights
(but not the strobes). But why was the system date wildly wrong, and why did some of the people on the ship
think that it was the date? We never found D.E. Nasco, so we don’t know if he was that Nasco or someone
with the same name. The passengers were mostly insane - I think that the IR shielding had failed, as well as
the hard radiation in some parts of the ship - so much of what they had said made little sense. I guess the
truth will never be known.

We are now proceeding to CMC HQ, and should get there in a couple of days. What then, I don’t know.
There will probably be some kind of investigation. I'll let you know as soon as I hear more.

All my respects,

Mexal
