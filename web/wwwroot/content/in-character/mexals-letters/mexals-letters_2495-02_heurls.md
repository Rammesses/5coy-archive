##### Message Text Begins

To : The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From : Marine Mexal, The Garavaglia, in orbit around Heurls.
Date: 27-02-2495.

Greetings!

It all started peacefully enough, sent to a UW member planet, Heurls, with orders from the UW Court to
police a mining dispute. As we approached, RSM Honer decided to run some intensive drill sessions, then a
couple of courses were run: Med-Tech 4 and the Radio Operators’ one. I was told to join the latter, but found
that Sgt. Turner just went through the stuff he’d taught just before the last mission again. I suppose I
shouldn’t have muttered "Foxtrot oscar alpha delta", but it was rather dull! Trying to have conversations in
“radio speak" was quite fun, though - Waylander kept sending messages to base asking for food.....

Then we were all called together again and Major "Fluffy Bunny" Harris arrived and opened his sealed
orders in our presence. He then proceeded to read them out. The situation was that on 31-01-2495 two
independent prospectors, Ivan Bilk and Renny Vark, had registered their discovery of a small but valuable
deposit of draken ore - and had sold their rights to both De Witt Mining and Iowa Power. To add to the
confusion, the locals were saying that the land was theirs, and the prospectors had been acting illegally. The
whole dispute was passed to the UW Courts, who have declared an interim injunction ordering the whole
area cleared. There have been reports of armed men in the area, some at least working for the corporations.
The main CMC presence on-planet is tied up in the capital dealing with rioting Hengists, so we have been
sent along to attend to the matter. The FSV Kreysig has dropped a Type 3 Facility Support Module for us,
and we will be landed by dropship nearby, to sweep in, take possession of the base and then begin to patrol
the area to enforce the Court’s orders. Meanwhile the Garavaglia will rendezvous with the Kreysig, and both
will provide support as necessary.

Our mission objectives are:-

1. Secure the base.
2. Conduct aggressive patrols of the operational area.
3. Eject any non-CMC personnel encountered.
4. Secure the area until relieved.

Fluffy Bunny was soon busy sorting out squads; I was even busier about issuing weapons and equipment. I
heard some good news, though: Ratch was promoted to Marine First Class and Dibley to Corporal, on an

acting basis for the time being. The squads were soon sorted, I was in Delta, commanded by Sgt. Apone and
consisting of Sgt. O’Shaunessy, me and a new Marine called Starion Lothmore. They’d decided to operate in
4-man bricks rather than our more normal eight-man squads this time. Then Sgt. Smith came along and tried
(unsuccessfully) to talk me into being the squad radio operator. Not much else happened that evening, there
was some kind of priest wandering around, said he came from the Church of the Holy Trinity, something to
do with a triumvirate of female gods - very weird and it was quite difficult to get rid of him! The medics
were busy sorting out all their drug supplies, and someone - Mimiannapandawawa I think - has come up with
a clever idea of issuing all key personnel, commanders and senior medics, with an emergency drug supply,
the idea being that anyone can administer these specially-selected resusitants to the individual in question,
even if they don’t know what they are doing. So you could soon identify the key people by the little blue
packets attached to them! We were soon packed off to bed, with a couple of puzzles to wonder about:
someone wandered off with some of my armourer forms - probably threw them out - and rather more
seriously, somebody took Fluffy Bunny’s mission orders. Or he lost them!

Next morning, we were called together to be given the rules of engagement before setting out. Most of the
people in the area are believed to be civilians, we are to insist that they leave, but must be polite to them. The
procedure is to begin with a challenge in the form "Colonial Marine Corps, identify yourself", preferably
twice, then to explain that this is a restricted area and they must remove themselves immediately and not to
return. Provided they make no trouble, they are to be allowed two hours to depart. Unless we actually come
under fire, we are not to open fire ourselves. This briefing ended with Fluffy Bunny again asking if anybody
had seen his missing set of mission orders.

We then all got into the dropship and went down to the planet’s surface. At a first glance, yet another cold,
bleak and damp place! Some interesting mosses, quite a few trees. At least it wasn’t actually raining,
although there was quite a lot of surface water and mud. We split up into our squads and scattered around the
area. In the distance ahead, I spotted a couple of figures and called the contact to Apone. We moved up, and
found two men, one in a long flowing brown coat, both with black armbands around the left upper arm.
Neither appeared to be armed. Apone issued the challenge as we’d been ordered, and these two turned out to
be extremely grumpy. They refused to say who they were, and wanted us to go away and leave them to their
"surveying". The larger - the one in the coat - actually tried to shove me away, the other was more vocal and
argued with Apone, saying that they had every right to be here, they’d been granted the land by the UW and
were not intending to shift. Eventually they stormed off, and we continued our sweep, arriving in the Facility
Support Module - a bleak and chilly edifice - without further event.

After Dag had sorted out some breakfast for those who wanted it - in other words, most of them, I still
haven’t come to terms with the quantities these Marines eat! - we had some visitors. A party of five, led by
an imposing man dressed in black with a long light coat, with a black armband on the right arm. The others,
two male and two female, all human, wore black armbands on the left arm. One of them was the big fellow
who'd tried to push me around. The leader said that he was the elder of his people, and that they were
refugees from Groombridge who had been settled here. They, quite naturally, did not want to be moved again
- and were decidedly unhappy when they realised that we were 5 Company, and started calling us “the planet
killers". It became increasingly obvious that they held us responsible for the mess on Groombridge. It seems
that the locals don’t want them here either, but they are determined not to be “hounded from here too" as the
elder put it. Then one of the females pulled a knife and attacked poor Mimiannapandawawa. Several Marines
jumped to pull her away, and to restrain some of the other members of the delegation who appeared to be
about to join in. Eventually everybody calmed down - I ended up nose to nose with the same big bloke in the
long coat I’d been pushed around by before - and the elder promised that the miscreant would be dealt with.

Fluffy Bunny then attempted to explain the situation, but to little avail, not helped by the elder recognising
the map we’d been given as his own settlement map that the UW had given them! Anyway, Fluffy Bunny
said that he’d contact Svjenson on the Garavaglia and see if they could be allowed to stay, and asked me to
escort them out.

As we left, they asked me if I’d been on Groombridge, and when I said that I had been there, I was asked if it
had "been my finger on the button.” I replied that on the contrary we had made every effort to avert the
tragedy, and that in any case, I’d been held prisoner by the Freedom for Chidain Movement, who HAD been
responsible for detonating the bomb. One of the females looked quite surprised, and commented that I was
lucky to be alive!

By the time I got back, O’Shaunessy had attended to Mimiannapandawawa, who’d sustained a nasty gash in
one arm, but was otherwise all right, and orders were being given for us all to go out on patrol. So off we
went, splashing over some decidedly muddy ground. Not far from the base facility I found an excellent spot
of cover, virtually encircled by a tangled thicket, which I suggested should be used as an observation point,
both for the view it afforded over the base and to stop any aggressors making use of it. Not sure if anybody
paid any attention to the suggestion, however; at this point we just carried on, and wandered around for quite
some time. Eventually we heard some firing in the distance, and hurried in that direction - arriving too late!
Seems that some of the others had run into some armed personnel - not sure if they came from one of the
corporations or what - and had had to fight them off.

We continued our patrol and encountered a lone human female carrying a large lantern, who said that she
was studying pond-dwelling worms. We explained that she had to leave the area, and she eventually agreed
to do so, grumbling. Never quite figured out what she was up to or why, she didn’t appear to work for any
university and yet the research she was describing wasn’t the sort of thing you’d expect from a corporation.
For that matter, the way she talked sounded as if she was an independent operator. Soon after seeing her out
of the area, we went back to the base.

Not that we stayed in long, we were soon back out again, and to the unpleasant sight of three men dressed in
blue beating up another fellow - who on closer examination turned out to be one of the Groombridge settlers,
the smaller more argumentative of the pair we’d met on the way in from the dropship. Some of us chased
after the attackers while others tended to the injured man. One aggressor managed to get away, but the other
two were cornered and asked for an explanation of their behaviour. Not that we got much, something along
the lines of "He deserves to die." Fluffy Bunny told us to send them packing, which we did, then returned to
the base. When we got back there, we found that the place was under attack from a couple of snipers. The
angle I was approaching at, I had a good line on one, and a fair idea of where the other was. I managed to
sneak up behind the first one, a human female, and picked her off from the rear before she even realised I
was there. Then I tried to do the same service for the other, a large human male, but I think he’d changed
position, or anyway as I approached he turned, saw me and let fly with a heavy weapon at close range.
Everything went black.

I opened my eyes to the welcome sight of Ruby Axe, who’d just administered the necessary resusitants - 7
this time - and was watching anxiously to see if I was all right. Apart from a bit of disorientation, which
seems to be normal for me, I was fine, so she sent me back into the base to fix screens. Didn’t stay long,
however, another sniper was soon having a go. Fluffy Bunny shot out the door shouting "Come on, Mexal",
so I followed out. Several people in the doorway were attempting to engage the sniper, then I caught a
glimpse of him moving around some kind of storage container at the far side of the clearing in which our
base stood, so I moved round in an attempt to flank him. Almost succeeded, too, I got round behind him and
was moving in close when he turned around and opened fire. Another heavy weapon.... and everything went
black yet again.

This time I woke up back in the base. Dibley was crouched over me, and being very reassuring “It’s OK,
Mexal, you’re safe back in base, the sniper’s been dealt with", but refusing to let me get up until my head
had cleared. Seems I’d needed another six units of resusitants. Once Dibley let me go, I settled down to reset
my screen.... and found that my RVC was not working correctly. So I soon had it apart, fixed the faulty
switch and then sorted out the screen. Fluffy Bunny came by at this point.

"Ah, Mexal" he said. "Busy?" When I said no, he told me to get Cardinal and go to interrogate a prisoner
they’d taken - not sure exactly when - who was locked up in a small room off the main hall. We went over
and opened the door - to be met by a burst of IR. I was rather glad that I’d put my screen back on after
resetting it! Apparently the prisoner, despite being handcuffed, had overpowered his guard and taken said
worthy’s weapon and screen, and was just about to make his way out when we had opened the door. He
looked rather displeased... and then rather unconscious when I knocked him out! Just as I went to report to
Fluffy Bunny, leaving some of the medics to deal with the guard and poor Cardinal, who’d been unscreened,
the base came under attack again, and it was a case of all hands to defence.

So out, and a running battle through the trees with a large number of armed men, quite a military-style
operation was being mounted against us. The skirmish went on for quite some time, with a fair exchange of
shots, but eventually they began to retreat As I followed up one stopped to fire a parting volley -
unfortunately at me, with the inevitable results!

Next thing I knew I was back in the base, with O’Shaunessy moaning that I had required seven units of
resusitant. Despite feeling a bit disorientated, I pointed out that - by my standards - that wasn’t too
excessive.... and then was puzzled to be handed some other tablet and told to take that as well. When I asked,
I was told that it was desamine. Odd, thought that was given as protection on planets with high background
counts of hard radiation. Later I sought out Commander Mimiannapandawawa and asked her if this planet
had such a count - she said that it didn’t, but she’d ordered that I was to be given desamine as CoedArian has
an extremely low background count so I needed additional protection. Be that as it may, they didn’t give me
any more the next day, although I believe the stuff only works for 24 hours. Maybe they thought I didn’t
need any more - or maybe they just plain forgot!

Once my head had cleared, I got out my RVC to reset my screen - and found that the dratted thing wasn’t
working again. I think I’d sat on it when I fell unconscious! So I had to take it apart and fix it once more,
interrupted by someone giving me a hamburger and by a bunch of local eco-freaks, who came in, complained
about the harm we were doing to the environment (which, of course, they failed to specify!) and sat down in
the doorway singing some song about "We shall not be moved." Perhaps, but several hefty Marines DID
move them, and they weren’t too impressed when I poured a bucket of water over them either!

Eventually both the hamburger and my repairs were completed. Fluffy Bunny called Cardinal, O’Shaunessy
and me, and told us to fetch that prisoner, who had been - I think - drugged unconscious, revive him and
question him. O’Shaunessy said that she was going to use cyclazine, and asked Cardinal and me to hold him
down for her. Cardinal had some idea of wanting to truss the poor fellow up with what appeared to be about a

mile of rope, until I pointed out that if he was that tightly bound, he’d probably break a few bones when |
given cyclazine! Eventually Cardinal was persuaded to settle on a pair of handcuffs. Once the prisoner was
awake, we sat him on a chair - I’m beginning to get worried about Cardinal, he insisted on tying him up! -
and we asked him who he was and what he was doing. It all came out very confused - he said that his name
was Franz and that he was a self-employed deep sea miner, working for a corporation called Nautilus. He
had been looking for "old Jules" when he’d met some of the Marines, who he claimed had opened fire
without challenge, warning or excuse. He asked if we’d seen "The Professor", apparently a colleague, who
was looking for gems, and claimed that he’d only been armed “for self defence”. Then he started asking
about other people, some names which I think Cardinal recognised although he didn’t explain, just said that
the fellow was talking rubbish - I don’t know how he reached this conclusion. The names included Buck
Rogers and someone called Blake who had seven companions. Apparently our prisoner reckoned these
people would come to rescue him, failing that there were 50-60 people who made up the crew of the
Nautilus, which he said was an undersea vessel. He also was convinced that we worked for either De Witt or
Iowa Power, and refused to believe that we were Marines. When we reported to Fluffy Bunny, he just told us
to lock the prisoner up again, and arranged for a shuttle to take him up to the Garavaglia.

Then we were all called together for a general debrief of events so far. We’d been flown in, dropped and
made a sweep into base, meeting two civilians, then secured the base. The Groombridge elder and his
companions had called; during their visit one of their number had attacked Mimiannapandawawa with a
knife, she’d been handed over to the civilian authorities. The elder had left obviously aggrieved at our
presence, and at the UW Court’s order. Apparently none of the locals had been informed of what was going
on, nor had any provision been made for them. CMC Command didn’t even appear to know that there was a
settlement here, let alone one of refugees given a home by the UW itself. We’d been attacked several times
by well-organised paramilitary types, and had also encountered the eco-freaks, the three locals who’d been
beating up one of the refugees and the prisoner Cardinal and I had questioned One patrol had heard an
explosion and on investigating they’d found a corpse and an ID patch which read "De Witt Security", but
was rather scruffy and possibly a fake.

Once this round-up of events so far had been completed, Fluffy Bunny said that we were to go to aggressive
patrolling, ensuring that anybody we encountered left at once, and showing no hesitation in shooting any
which open fire on us. The Groombridge settlers, however, are to be allowed to remain. Then Commander
Mimiannapandawawa reported that the drugs state was adequate, and asked us all how many times we’d
been shot. To a gale of laughter from the others, I had to own up to having been taken out three times, only a
few of the rest had been hit once or twice!

Plans were soon laid for a major sweep out from the base, with both Calvin’s and Apone’s squads
participating. Off we went, along a muddy track and then through woods. A few figures were spotted up
ahead, and these soon proved to be unfriendly, a pitched battle was soon in progress. I was kept busy
scuttling around resetting screens as well as playing my part in the combat. I’m not too sure of all that
happened, I remember crossing a few small streams, dodging around several stands of trees, and exchanging
considerable amounts of fire with the aggressors. Then one of them targeted on me and in a sudden flare of
pain everything went black yet again.

When I regained consciousness I was back in the base, Mimiannapandawawa had just administered
cyclazine and both Ruby Axe and O’Shaunessy were holding on to me. Once my head had cleared, I sorted
Out my screen and was soon back outside with the rest of Apone’s squad. It appeared that one Marine - who
had only just been posted in, I never even found out his name - was missing, and I regret to say that all we
found was his corpse, which was brought back to the base. On the way back, we encountered some
prospectors, and informed them that they were required to leave, They weren’t too happy, and it transpired
that they’d already met another squad of Marines and some of the female members of the party were
claiming sexual harassment.... not sure exactly what they’d objected to. Fluffy Bunny appeared from
somewhere, and listened to what they had to say, handing me his sidearm before he went anywhere near
them. Once they’d gone, he came back for it, muttering "Timewasters."

Back at the base, we received some more visitors, all human, a male and two females. They asked to see
Major Harris by name, and were allowed in. They said that they were members of the local council, and that
they wanted us to go away. Moreover, they had an injunction from the Heurls Federal Court ordering us to
leave. Fluffy Bunny explained that our orders, coming from the UW Court, overruled anything the local
courts might say, and that we had jurisdiction in the area whether they liked it or not. The councillors were
not able to explain the importance of this patch of land, or why they were so eager for us to go, but they
claimed that they could deal with the corporation troops on their own..... then said that they had not been in
contact with them. Odd. They wanted to know what prisoners we had - and were told none (well, he was
long gone up to the Garavaglia, after all!). Fluffy Bunny checked with Svjenson, up on the Garavaglia,
before sending them away. They didn’t look too happy as they went.

Not long after this, the Groombridge elder was back. After a chat with Harris, he made a long and
impassioned speech to us all. The gist of it was that they had seen their planet destroyed, and now they had
met the destroyers. They did not wish to be dispossessed again, nor did he wish to see his people harmed by
those who care for money rather than that which is in their hearts. Despite their misgivings about us, their
only option appears to be to ask us to protect them in honour. Then the elder asked Harris if he could say
honestly that we were not responsible for the destruction of Groombridge. Harris replied that on the contrary,
we'd tried our damnedest to prevent the nuclear device from being set off. The elder then said that he’d go
and talk with his people, try and get them to accept us as their protectors.

He went on to say that they believe that others (presumably the warring corporations - or is it the locals up to
something?) will attempt to take what little they now have, but that they would rather die than be
dispossessed again. All that they can say about these aggressors is that they wear clothes of blue, and that
their power is the power of the gun. The settlers have received a threat, that if they are not out of their camp
by 2230 zulu tonight they will be killed. Should his people agree, the idea is that we will go to their camp,
and give these aggressors a warm welcome when they attack!

The elder went off, and I was sent out on guard duty.... rather annoyed, I’d just made myself a hot drink! So I
took the drink along. Needless to say, some more aggressors came calling, and I guess I must have made an
interesting sight, gun in one hand mug in the other. I think there were three bad guys out there, all armed with
heavy weapons. I exchanged fire with them, shooting around the doorframe, but eventually the accumulated
fire got the better of me and amid the usual flare of pain everything went black.

Next thing I knew, I was inside the main hall, feeling lousy. I couldn’t get my eyes to focus properly, and it
took some time to realise that it was O’Shaunessy who had an arm round me and was being reassuring.
People were running in and out, it was obvious that the battle was still raging. I fixed a few screens, then
took my turn at the door again. Looked pretty confusing outside, two or three unconscious bodies lying on
the ground, incoming IR from several directions, people dodging around. Eventually, the firing died down a
bit, and I went out to check on the bodies. The first couple I came across belonged to some of the attackers -
motley assortment of clothing, military-style weaponry - then I found a Marine (can’t remember who)
half-concealed behind a crate. Someone else came and offered to take him in, and I moved further into the
shadows, having spotted some feet. These belonged to Marine Bean, who was slumped unconscious. I
picked him up, and headed back to the base. In the meantime the firing had picked up again - I think my
screen had taken two or three hits, although I hadn’t really been paying attention - and as I crossed the open
area towards the door, I came under concentrated fire. Again, with a sudden burst of agony, everything went
black. My last thought was of Bean - at least he would be visible, but I was hoping I hadn’t dropped him too
hard as I went down.

When I opened my eyes again, it was to cyclazine and a blurred face looming over me. Everything was
confused, then I heard a worried voice “Are you all right, Mexal?" I asked who it was, still couldn’t quite
focus, and the voice said “It’s Caitlin, don’t worry, you’re safe. They’ve all gone now.” Eventually things
began to clear, and I found that most of the Marines were getting ready to mount a raid on a location believed
to be being used by some of the aggressors. To my disappointment, they wouldn’t let me go along, said that I
should rest a bit. Rest? I was told to stand guard! Harris reassured me that I would be allowed to go to the
settlers’ camp later on - word had by now been received that they had decided to accept our assistance. Not
sure how well they got on - came back in reasonable order, I think they chased a good few away, but did not
cause as much damage as they would have liked.

Eventually it was time to make our way to the settlers’ camp - they’d sent one of their men to guide us. The
rest had moved out of the area temporarily, we hoped they’d be safe there. It was very dark. Harris told
O’Shaunessy and me to stick close to him as we went to the centre of the camp and set about lighting a fire.
Everybody else spread out, concealing themselves amongst the trees. Then we heard voices approaching, and
two figures came into view. Harris and someone else - think it may have been Calvin - pounced on them with
knives, and forced one - a human female - to call out to the rest of their party that it was safe to come
forwards. They approached, but I think that they were suspicious, and it wasn’t long before firing could be
heard. O’Shaunessy and I were crouched near the fire, peering into the darkness, trying to spot the
aggressors... then I think someone must have crept up behind me, all I felt was tremendous pain then
blackness engulfed me.

Unmeasured time later, I found myself flat on my back, pinned down. The effects of cyclazine were taking
their course, the world was spinning crazily. Everything was still dark, I couldn’t see anything, just blurred
shapes. Someone was holding my wrists, I couldn’t move. A voice was repeating "Talk to me, Mexal, talk to
me" over and over again. Sounded like Sergeant Turner, but he isn’t a med-tech. Couldn’t tell which way was
up, couldn’t stop shaking. It seemed to take forever for my head to clear. Eventually, Turner let me sit up, but
was still holding on to me. He asked for my RVC, then wanted to know how to use it to reset my screen -
someone had given me an MS-CIV screen for the time being. Turner wasn’t getting anywhere with the RVC,
so I took it. My hands were still shaking - don’t know why - but after several attempts I finally managed to
complete the Screen Repair Program.

By now everybody else was ready to return to base. I was still shaky, balance not all that it might have been.
Most of the others seemed all right, but poor O’Shaunessy was looking dazed - turned out she’d also become
unconscious and someone had given her the contents of her package of emergency resusitants as all the other
medics had been busy. Back in the base, the inevitable debrief. The aggressors had sent in two scouts, who’d
been taken at knifepoint, even once jumped they hadn’t appeared to realise who we were! After a big
firefight, the aggressors had been beaten off or killed, but we had two prisoners. These, in common with all
the rest, appeared to be local kids wearing De Witt uniforms, and armed with military weapons and screens.
Someone - think it was Ruby Axe - asked me to check a captured weapon, to see where it had come from.
Normal factory serial number, they may be able to trace it, if the sale was legitimate.

Worse news - poor Waylander Blackthorne was dead. And Cardinal was faced with the nasty task of
removing the security collar he’d been wearing, before the fact that the life signs telemetry had ceased
caused the signal to trigger the explosive charge to be sent. Fortunately, he succeeded in neutralising the
thing. By now, it was very late, and quiet outside, so we were sent to bed. Don’t know who stood guard, but
for once not me!

Next morning dawned crisp and clear. Thought about staying in bed, they won’t shoot me there.... then
Turner waved his sidearm at me and said "Bets?" Got up and went downstairs, made myself useful doing
some washing-up. Then Turner was calling for me - wanted to run an exam for radio operators, and I was
required to sit it, along with several others - Cassel, Zeus, Axe, Ratch, Smith, not sure who else. We all
beavered away, the rest dealt with one or two snipers outside. Once the exam was finished, we joined in.
Harris corned me as I came out, and sent me round the back of the base, calling directions. Unfortunately, he
vectored me straight into the sights of one of the snipers, with the inevitable result. The incoming fire was so
murderous, so accurate that I guess the sniper had been listening to Harris, and had lined up his weapon just
waiting for me to come into sight!

I came round inside the base, someone’s arms around me. I couldn’t see anything, all blurred and some odd
purple flashes, A voice said "It’s me, Caitlin, you’ll be OK, just sit still, don’t try to move”. Even sitting still
everything felt like it was lurching around, and despite O’Shaunessy’s hug, I was shaking violently. Slowly,
things began to settle down, but my vision was still blurred. O’Shaunessy moved off, someone else took her
place but I couldn’t make out who it was until I heard "I’m Ruby, you'll be all right soon." Eventually I was
able to get up, but before I’d gotten very far, Harris told me to sit down and rest. I did so for a while, then Jf
went to the door to see what was happening - and was promptly ordered in no uncertain terms to stay inside
by Dibley. He wasn’t going to take no for an answer, I think he was about to pull rank, then O’Shaunessy
came along and led me back inside, asking what was going on. Well, I didn’t know either, so she suggested
that I talk with Mimiannapandawawa, and in the meantime just sit quietly inside beside her while she got on
with her paperwork.

By then some visitors had arrived, a human female with a large human male acting as bodyguard - and very
annoyed at having been made to give his sidearm to Apone. Harris sat down to talk to her, calling Calvin
over, and glancing in my direction. “Keep notes" he said, then called Mimiannapandawawa over as well as
the female announced that she was the planetary UW representative, name of Goldine. She was in an
extremely bad mood, ranted on about how outraged she was at our actions, and that we should have removed
all the mercenaries from the area and left the locals alone. Harris tried to explain what his orders had said,
and how he’d carried them out, but she was very aggressive, and not listening to a word he said. She just
kept repeating that our job was to remove mercenaries, and didn’t seem to have the faintest idea what our
orders actually said, although she moaned a lot about the pressure that she was under.

Then more visitors arrived, one of the local councillors who’d been round yesterday, who announced herself
as Councillor Holly and her companion as a local sheriff. (That’s a type of lawman I think.) She said that
she’d come to see if we had obeyed the court order they’d brought yesterday. Meanwhile, the UW
representative was complaining that Holly had been let in without being searched, oblivious to the
explanation that Holly was known to us, whereas she’d turned up without ID! It soon degenerated into an
argument, the UW rep accusing Holly of making money from the corporations. Harris turned to me and said
"Make a note of that, Mexal." Holly denied this, saying that she doesn’t know who is arming the locals.

 

Harris then sprung a bombshell: they’d gotten a mercenary prisoner who was ready and willing to identify
the people who’d hired them, whom he had said were the locals. So, would Holly either wait until he was
brought down from the Garavaglia or arrange for pictures of the councillors to be made available. She began
to bluster, and Harris sent Turner to communicate with Captain Jacques on the Garavaglia to send the
mercenary down in a shuttle.

"Of course we hire mercenaries to protect ourselves” Holly burst out suddenly. "The corporations believe
possession is nine-tenths of the law, so we have to defend ourselves." Harris told the sheriff to arrest her, but
he looked decidedly shifty, so he changed his mind and ordered Apone to arrest her instead. She protested
vehemently, so did the sheriff. Eventually Harris bullied her into revealing the location of the mercenaries’
base, then turned her over to Apone, who called Cassel and me to escort her off. She kept shouting “Don’t
touch me", but refused to go with us, so Apone ordered the pair of us to lead her away. By the time we got
back, the UW rep had gone, complaining to the last.

It wasn’t long before we were all getting ready to make an assault on the mercenaries’ base. I managed to
catch Mimiannapandawawa to ask if I was going to be allowed to participate; she was trying to find out if
Dibley had been told by Harris to make me stay inside. It turned out that Dibley had made the decision
himself, on medical grounds, and just informed Harris. The upshot was, I was allowed to go, but Apone was
called over by Mimiannapandawawa and, I think, given specific instructions that if I were to get shot, he was
to ensure that I was given diazamorphite and brought back to base unconscious rather than resuscitated in the
field. They were getting worried about the bad reactions I was experiencing, and wanted to be able to keep
an eye on me.

Anyway, we were soon off, and making a sweep through woodland towards the location we’d been given.
Nobody there, but we continued on and soon spotted some figures in a thicket on the far side of a small
stream. Harris, right beside me, shouted "Come on, charge!" and leaped over. I scrambled after, and before I
had time to look round was right in the middle of the mercenaries. All was confusion, people firing in all
directions. I spotted a group of mercenaries and advanced, firing. Then one turned and levelled a heavy
weapon directly at me..... everything was happening so fast I barely even felt the shots before collapsing
unconscious.

When I opened my eyes again, I was on the Garavaglia. From what I’ve been able to gather, we managed to
wipe out virtually all the mercenaries - I think one escaped. Councillor Holly is facing charges of corruption,
so is the UW rep and the sheriff. The land rights have been divided between the locals and the Groombridge
settlers. As for the corporations, lowa Power appear to have been the “bad guys”, it turned out that as soon as
the courts got involved De Witt decided to withdraw their claim. (Probably intending to come back once
everybody else had gotten into trouble fighting over the land!)

As for the Marines, once we’d returned to base, a shuttle had taken us back to the Garavaglia as the Marines
from the capital - who should have been taking care of all this - arrived to take up residence in the base! A
few announcements had also been made, once everybody was back on the Garavaglia. The promotions
announced earlier - Ratch as MFC and Dibley as Corporal - had been confirmed; and Cardinal was to be
mentioned in dispatches for his bravery in defusing the bomb on Grant’s World and Waylander’s security
collar. As for Waylander, he had been given a posthumous mention for saving Oslo’s life, and all charges
against him were to be wiped from the records. Finally, the establishment of the Combat Engineering
Department was formally announced - with me, in the rank of sergeant, as its Chief!

Typical - that when I at long last get a promotion, I am unconscious in the medical facility, and only hear
about it later! Still, ’11 write again soon, and let you know all that’s going on.

All my respects,

Mexal
