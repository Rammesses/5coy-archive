##### Message Text Begins

To : The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From : Sergeant Mexal, Connet.
Date : 26-03-2495.

Greetings!

Like many missions, this latest one sounded ever so simple when the orders arrived. A planet by the name of
Connet had joined the United Worlds, and was required to provide a Marine base. We were being sent to
establish the CMC presence, a flag-showing mission, so to speak. Trouble is, when you wave a flag, there’s
always someone who decides to shoot at it.....

Anyway, the Garavaglia arrived in orbit around Connet the night before we were due to land. We had a large
number of recruits - nice peaceful task, so plenty of time to field-train them. I was kept busy issuing
uniforms, weapons and screens. RSM Honer was on leave, so at least nobody made us do much drill -
various people such as Turner and Martins made attempts to run parades, but nobody really knows what they
are doing. So the recruits had it easy. As well as them, we had a new addition in the form of a Urthankoid.
These are natives of Altair IV, a planet decimated by plague several years ago. Humanoid in appearance, but
green-skinned, with yellow fingernails and radically-different customs from the norm. Before he joined us,
we were all warned that he would take offence if anyone touched him or his possessions, gestured at him
with their left hand or called him a "grob" - a rather derogatory nickname for his species. They are so averse
to being touched that all the med-techs had to be introduced to him and given specific permission to touch
him should they need to give him medical treatment. When he did turn up, he seemed quite a friendly chap,
name of Kishoshal. He was fascinated by me, the only other non-human around, and periodically wandered
over to peer curiously at my ears.

The evening passed quietly, with the Marines telling the recruits the usual tall stories about past missions.
Turner had gotten a supply of a delicacy from his home planet, Alpha Centauri, something called shellmouth.
He was attempting to get us to try it, but I was about the only person willing to taste it.... I’m glad I did, it
was delicious! I guess most people were put off by the fact that it has a bluish tinge.

The next morning we were roused early, and given breakfast - and a room inspection - then they called
everyone together on parade for the mission briefing and squad assignments to be given. I’d already been
kept busy making lists for Fluffy Bunny and for Calvin (who was organising the squads). Once everybody
was organised, Fluffy Bunny gave the mission briefing.

Connet had been colonised just before the outbreak of the Colonial War, and did not participate in it, nor did
they join the United Worlds when that organisation was formed at the end of the War. Since then the
planetary government has stayed in contact with the UW but has remained in the background, just watching
what’s been going on. Connet society is mainly agrarian with some light industry. The population lives in
scattered small communities with few towns and just one large city, which is where the sole spaceport is to
be found. Hitherto the planet’s population and economy has been stable, but the new government thinks that
their society is beginning to decline and so approached the UW, offering to accept refugees from
Groombridge in return for UW assistance in revitalising their economy. The UW was interested, but has
insisted that Connet become a full member and has laid down a condition that they must establish a
permanent CMC base, although it does not have to be manned all the time. The Connet government is not
too happy about this condition but has agreed to allow some Marines on planet to see how it works out.
Meanwhile, other UW agencies are beginning to send in advisors. So we have been handed what is basically
a flag-showing mission, along with the opportunity to give the recruits their final field training. Svjenson
obviously thought it was a simple mission, he’d gone off to observe a Fleet exercise.

The squad organisations were then announced. I was in Bravo, commanded by Oslo, along with Fugazi,
Silver (haven’t seen her for a while, it was good to have her back!), Kishoshal, Turner, Beck and Lothmore.
Alpha squad was commanded by Calvin and consisted of Bean, Dibley, Larnor, Apone, Cardinal, Martins
and Schwartzkopf. Finally, Hotel squad would be Harris, Mimiannapandawawa, O’Shaunessy and Gaunt -
he’s an OTC chaplain who used to spend quite a lot of time with 5 Company, but has been busy elsewhere
for the past couple of years. The recruits would be trained by a Sergeant Nim, who’d been posted in to cover
for the missing Captain Zwalf, lost on Grant’s World a couple of missions ago.

We were then sent off to the dropship, and down to the planetary surface. We landed in a deserted clearing
maybe half a klick from the base facility provided for us. A deputation of locals had been supposed to meet
us, but there was nobody there, so we set off along the track towards the base, Alpha squad in the lead, then
the recruits, with Bravo squad bringing up the rear. As we went along, the people at the front kept on halting
the advance, as they found various items strewn around - tools, a crate, a broom and some children’s toys.
Looked like they’d been abandoned. When we arrived at the clearing where the base facility was, it too was
deserted. The door was half-open, with a coat hanging on it. Martins was sent forward to investigate.
Meanwhile, the recruits were split up into several groups and organised to assist in a perimeter sweep whist
the base was checked out. Rather to my surprise, I was told to take charge of half a dozen of them, and was
required to direct them as they prowled around, looking rather nervous, poor dears.

Once the place had been checked out as clear, and the perimeter sweeps had also found nothing, we went
inside. No signs of life at all, although apparently there should have been people there to welcome us. The
only sign of anyone having been there was a spilt can of black paint in the entryway. Otherwise, it was a fine
base - I began to wonder about asking to be transferred to the permanent Marine presence, if one is set up!
We soon sorted out bunk rooms - I ended up with Turner and a couple of recruits - and then I was told to call
everybody together and parade them in the main hall. Made a change to be doing the shouting. Once

everybody was lined up, Calvin arrived, told the recruits to join Nim for their training and sent us of Bravo :
Squad out on guard duty. Alpha were to sort things out inside, then relieve us.

Outside, all was peaceful, to begin with. We spread out and found places to keep watch from. I settled down
in my assigned spot, looking along a track in the opposite direction to the one we’d come from the dropship.
Then I was disturbed by hearing my name called, someone was shouting that Major Harris wanted to see me
inside the base. I scuttled in. Harris and Calvin were sitting at a table in one corner, conferring. Nearby,
Mimiannapandawawa and O’Shaunessy were busy over their med supplies. I went over and saluted.

"Ah, Mexal.” said Harris. "Perhaps you can explain this. We’ve received a message, which I read but J
couldn’t understand, then I saw that it was addressed to you. Read it, then explain it." I took the message
form, standard CMC format, and found to my surprise that it was from Alexal - message title "11th
Anniversary” and all it said was "To Ol’Pointy - Forget something?" Then I had to try and explain
CoedArianese pairbond customs to Harris, who fortunately didn’t seem very interested, so I was able to
make my escape.

Just as I went back out again, a strange mist was spotted, didn’t seem to fit in with atmospheric conditions. I
fished out some chemical detector paper and - despite Oslo shouting something about "What are you doing?”
- went over to test the mist. Nothing untoward, I’m glad to say. Then, amid another swirl of mist, several
figures appeared, wearing what seemed to be standard CMC camouflage. On being challenged, they said that
they were "Five Company", then opened fire. The mist swirled again, and they disappeared.

Before we could do much else, four civilians arrived, and were escorted into the base. Alpha squad came out
to relieve us, and we went inside too. The base had no integral building screen, so I settled down now I had
the time, and I was able to jury-rig one.... not too sure how well it would last, but better than nothing. I also
had a chat with one of the recruits in our bunk room - fellow called John Doe. He has a strange tale to tell,
says that he cannot remember any event over four months ago. Yet it appears that he has at some time had
military training, he says that all that he’s being taught is familiar; and come to think of it, I noticed that he
checked over his sidearm most professionally when I issued it to him.

The civilians, meanwhile, were talking to Fluffy Bunny, who was asking them about these mists, and had
obviously gotten the idea that they were a similar phenomenon to the ones encountered on Grant’s World a
couple of missions ago. The locals looked pretty dubious at the idea of people appearing and disappearing,
then someone had the "bright" idea of showing them a copy of the Interstella report on the events at Grant’s
World. They were still disbelieving, but strangely decided to give credence to some of the other things - like
a report that one of the colony prep team had claimed that I had stabbed her. One of them read it out aloud
and said "We hope that sort of thing won’t happen here."

Then O’Shaunessy called me over. She said that Connet had unusually high hard radiation background
levels, and that everybody had to have desamine injections. No escape. Once I’d gotten away from her, I met
the locals, who were leaving. They were curious about my ears, and talked about wanting to meet "aliens";
then one asked me my name. When I said "Mexal” she backed off hurriedly.... guess she must have been the
one reading that spurious report from Interstella!

Soon enough, we were back outside again on guard. In the distance there were shouts and a strange clanging
sound. We hurried in that direction, and came upon the incredible sight of three people in plate mail engaged
in a sword fight. As we watched, amazed, a white mist arose around them and as it cleared they seemed to
fade away. An idea struck me, and I pulled out a scanner and checked for magnetic flux, finding very high
levels - just like what had been reported on Grant’s World. Then I noticed that one of the armoured figures
had left a sword behind. It was the centre of a massive magnetic anomaly, but as I bent towards it, more mist
swirled and it vanished. Drat!

Oslo ordered a return to base, but as we turned to go, more of the sword-fighting sounds could be heard
behind me. I turned to investigate, and found that I was in a really good position, just behind two of them
who looked as if they were bout to attack the third. Then one of them spotted me, and called out "Behind
you, my lord!" He turned towards me, and thrust a large sword under my nose, saying "Get away from this
place." I stood my ground and asked who they were, saying that we were the Colonial Marines - and being
VERY careful not to make any threatening gestures, that sword was sharp and the man holding it looked like
he could use it! He repeated his command to leave, then turned away. The two men then charged at the third,
knocked him to the ground and began hacking at him with their swords. He screamed a couple of times, then
lay still. The mist swirled around them, and again they faded away. According to my scanner, magnetic flux
was going wild again.

We returned to base, and found the same locals as before outside, in a decidedly evil temper. They were
shouting at poor Apone, and demanding to speak to someone in charge. Eventually Harris arrived - I think
he’d been off looking around the area - and the locals announced that the whole population of their village,
bar themselves, had disappeared. They blamed us - saying we’d abducted them, or killed them, or sold them
into slavery or some such - although the nearest they had to evidence was that this had happened since we
had arrived! Harris, of course, denied all this.... and was promptly called a liar for his pains. Understandably,
he was not best pleased with that, and told them that if that was their opinion they might as well go now.
Their leader started off something about "If you don’t return them within the hour we'll..." at which Harris
interrupted "Seeing as you don’t believe what I’m saying to you, you’d better carry out your threats at once"
and stormed off into the base.

We then switched to 4-man patrols, and I was soon out with Turner, Beck and Lothmore. We encountered
two contacts, dressed as others had been in what appeared to be CMC camouflage. As I watched them, they
looked as if they were intending to open fire, then turned and ran off. We gave pursuit, and they led us a
merry chase before we finally lost them. By now it was coming up to lunchtime, so we returned to base for
some food and the inevitable debrief.

Harris summarised events so far: after arriving, and finding the place deserted instead of the welcome we’d
expected, we’d sighted what appeared to be members of the CMC arriving and departing in mists; met the
deputation of locals - the second time they’d come they had been attacked on leaving by several people
wearing military screens and armed with hand weapons, who’d mounted a very uncoordinated attack; then
there were the incidents with the knights in armour; another patrol had found what looked like the outline of
a body formed of some kind of ash or dust. Hmm - tried to quiz them a bit on this, but they hadn’t made
many observations, although they said that the grass under the shape wasn’t affected in any way. Not quite
like the circles of white powder on Grant’s World - have to wait for some analysis on that.

Harris then told us that he’d made a full report on events so far through the normal channels. As Svjenson is
off on a Fleet exercise, this meant that the report was routed from the Garavaglia to Area Command, where it
had arrived on the desk of one Lieutenant Colonel Jeffries. Who by all accounts is not much use at all, and
had incensed Harris so much that he took the unprecedented step of reading out Jeffries’ response to the
report: “I cannot believe that in such a short a time you have managed to put things back by years. If your
raving reports do not cease you will be removed from command. You have four hours to sort it out."

Just then we were interrupted by a cloud of mist at the entrance to the base facility. A figure appeared out of
it, strangely dressed but his features were familiar to many of us - Wellesley, one of the Marines missing on
Grant’s World. His first words were “They’ve got Zwalf", but then degenerated into strange ramblings,
which I think referred to events in his ancestors’ lives - he comes from a long line of military commanders
on Earth. The clothing he wore was reminiscent of old military pictures from that planet, although somewhat
inaccurate, more as if someone was making an attempt to dress in an historical style than had actually
acquired archaic kit. The medics led him away.

So, back to patrolling, in four-man groups as before. Our sweep was uneventful, and followed by a period of
guard duty, then back in. Not that I got an opportunity to rest, I was sent off to investigate the site where the
outline of a body had been found, being given Apone, Beck and Dibley as escort. There wasn’t much to be
seen, just a solid two-dimensional outline of what must have been a fairly small humanoid. I grabbed a
sample, and took some measurements with the scanner - faint magnetic fluctuations, which led me to believe
that there’s a decay with time - then Apone, who’d been edgy all along, insisted that we return to base. As
we headed that way, sounds of combat could be heard. Figuring out the angles and the terrain, I pointed out a
route that should bring us round behind whoever was attacking, both as a means of making a surprise
counter-attack on them and - should they be involved with the swirling mists - getting a good close-up look
at the phenomenon. But Apone refused to listen and insisted on returning along the main track, so I missed
everything. By now I wanted to make some measurements close up to an incidence of the mists, as theories
were beginning to come together nicely in my mind.

Frustrated, I went back into the base with the other, and repaired screens for those who had been involved in
the skirmish, followed by another spell of guard duty. Some more aggressors obligingly appeared through
the by now familiar swirls of mist - I left the others to see them off and concentrated on making
measurements. Magnificent magnetic anomalies. It’s beginning to look like a “rip in the fabric" effect
somewhat similar to the one caused by a JSE drive, but instead of opening into the n-space of a hyperspace fj
jump it goes straight through to some other place. Time, possibly, given knights and the like, or maybe other
parallel universes. The magnetic anomalies are caused by abnormal rotational forces on atoms at the
interface point. I was by now itching to have an opportunity to settle down and analyse the data properly, and
was hoping that I wouldn’t exceed the storage capacity of the scanner before I had a chance to download the
data!

Back inside, Oslo wanted to summarise the latest events - not sure where Harris was, but there was no sign
of him. The interesting information that those who’d been looking at people rather than scanner readouts (!)
had gathered was that the party of aggressors had comprised two unscreened people in civilian dress, and
others with both IR and projectile weapons. The unscreened people had not been affected by the IR fired.
Someone had also found an ID card, looked like a CMC one, in the name "Major Nasco." Interesting -
before I joined, 5 Coy had been commanded by a Nasco who had a reputation for intolerance and violence
bordering on the psychotic, he’d been suspected of several crimes including murders, use of projectile
weapons, links with corporations and the Brotherhood and infecting the whole planet of Altair IV with a
plague! I then tried to explain what I’d found out about these... well, dimensional gates seems as good a
name as any.... but Oslo was openly dismissive. Humpf! Technophobic nerds are all we need.

Shortly thereafter, the alarm was raised again from outside. Several figures had been sighted, a mix of
camouflage dress and white protective clothing, these last were carrying some kind of containers. An attack
was Called., a headlong chase along a straight track. A charge was called - I think Harris was back by then,
certainly his style! - and matters soon became rather confusing. I took several hits from the aggressors, and
after an exchange of shots, everything went black.

I came round to cyclazine, and shouts of "Get Mexal to check this body." As soon as I’d regained my feet, I
was directed over to the corpse of one of the aggressors, dressed in CMC uniform, and told to search it. Not a
thing. Serial numbers had been filed off weapon and screen, no ID, nothing. Then there were more shouts
from the far end of the track, where the main body of the aggressors, including those in protective clothing,
had been. "Send the tech up here, we need her to check out a box." I scampered in that direction, meeting a_ fj
party of Marines returning to base with a prisoner, who took one look at me and began to shout "Die,
deviant!", struggling with his captors. Most puzzling - I assume he meant that he didn’t like non-humans, but
with my helmet on it isn’t easy to tell that I am not human - the main distinguishing feature is, of course, my
ears.

Anyway, I carried on down to the end of the track, where I found that the aggressors had dropped one of the
crates they’d been carrying. There were several biohazard markings on it, and Martins, wearing a respirator,
was poking around. He asked for my scanner, quite sensibly saying that although he didn’t know how to use
it, he had the kit to get close to the box in relative safety. I passed it over, explained which buttons to press
and let him get on with it. When he’d finished, he laid it on the ground and backed off, leaving me to
decontaminate it (just as well I had some fuller’s earth tucked away!) and pick it up using a clear plastic bag
as added protection. Once I’d done so, I looked at the readings - about three unknown chemical compounds;
sufficient magnetic flux to conclude the box had been taken through a dimensional gate; but at least it
appeared that it wasn’t leaking. I recommended that we request some protective gear for handling
biohazardous material forthwith.

The main body of us moved back to the base, leaving some to guard the box, although I think that they were
planning to move it - cautiously! - a bit closer. Back inside, I armoured some screens. Kisoshal came up to
me, grabbed hold of me (I thought he didn’t like physical contact!) by the front of my smock and grunted
"Fix screen, now!", which I did. Then Turner called me over, waving a message form. "Mexal" he said, "Go
and send this - secure IRAG channel on the comms-2 uplink to the G2. It ought to reach Svjenson without
passing across the desk of that Jeffries in Area." I scuttled off, hearing one of the officers quizzing Turner
about “Does she know how?” as I went. Well, Turner, who has charge of such things, has been teaching me -
after all, communications are part of the CED, so it helps if the CED Chief has some idea of procedures! -
and he wouldn’t have asked me if he didn’t think I could do it. Be that as it may, I left him to argue the point,
and sent the message. All I got was a routine acknowledgement and onwards transmission, but the IRAG
codes should make sure that the message caught up with Svjenson wherever he is.

I’d only just gotten back when Turner told me to flash a message to Captain Jacques on the Garavaglia, to
ask for a drop of biohazard handling kit. So back to the uplink. Jacques said that he’d see what he could
arrange, but it wasn’t the sort of thing they carry as a matter of routine. I reported back, and then got sent
outside to see if the box had been transferred up to the base yet.

I found that Martins had put it in a corner and settled down to keep everybody away from it, so I ducked
back inside to report this, then went out again to find that a single aggressor was attempting to make off with
it. Poor Martins was trying to prevent the fellow - who’d already grabbed the box - from making off with it;
the attacker was meanwhile threatening to break the box open if he wasn’t allowed to leave with it. I began
to creep around the side, hoping that the aggressor would concentrate on Martins. He made a few threatening
gestures in my direction, fired a few shots - wildly, I’m glad to say! - but wasn’t paying sufficient attention
to notice that I was edging closer all the time. By now some back up had arrived, no doubt to Martin’s relief,
but the aggressor then turned to me, grinned nastily as he hefted the box and said "Plague", before trying to
make a run for it. I opened fire,, then he opened up on me from fairly close range with a heavy weapon, and
in a flare of pain everything went black. Last thing I remember he was just about standing over me, still
holding the box and exchanging fire with other Marines.

I opened my eyes back in the base, with Silver taking care of me. "Don’t worry” she said, "The attacker’s
been killed and the box recovered." Once I was on my feet again, Turner was calling. A message was coming
in from the Garavaglia, and he wanted me to take notes. The message ran "Colonel Svjenson is unavailable
at this time, but requires to speak urgently and personally to Major Harris. Svjenson will be on the air in five
minutes’ time.” Harris looked rather worried, thrust a sheet of paper at me and said "Write a summary of
what’s happened so far - all the appearances, Nasco, the box, your theories...." then vanished back into his
quarters. I scribbled furiously.

When I’d finished I was sent back outside again, where Martins - still guarding the box - enlisted my help in
covering all angles of approach. I found a convenient log to sit on, and soon spotted someone attempting to
sneak up from one side. I pretended not to have seen him until he got into what he thought was a good firing
position and was just raising his weapon - then I shot him! He looked disgusted as he took several hits before
he was able to make good his escape. Not long afterwards, another couple approached. Martins shouted
"Chase them off!", so this time I advanced, firing, and pursued them off into the forest, dodging around trees
as we exchanged fire. Some more Marines came out to assist as I chased them away - unfortunately one had
some kind of backpack-powered heavy weapon and the amount of fire he was putting down was murderous.
Despite ducking around a stand of trees, and landing a fair few shots on him and his partner, he got the better
of me and everything went black again.

I came round in the base, sprawled on the floor with Dibley being his usual reassuring self. I was feeling a bit
dizzy and disorientated, and he wouldn’t let me get up until my head had cleared. Meanwhile, quite a lot
seemed to have been happening. The recruits had just about finished their training, and so they as well as us
were treated to a debrief of events so far. A patrol had brought in a human - at least I think she was - female
dressed in long flowing robes, who said that her name was Peace, and that she came from another dimension
via what she called a "glitch." Back home, she claims she’s a Witchfinder, and that the glitches are operated
or controlled by witches. These witches - not sure if they are from her universe or another - have made
contact with what can best be described as a parallel 5th Company, from a world where Nasco and his racist
ideals have become the accepted norm. They have a designer plague, and intend - acting with ot under the
influence of the witches - to wipe out all life in the dimension Peace comes from. She said that if she had one
or two of these witches under her control, she would be able to manipulate the glitch herself, to send people
back where they belong and close it down. Apparently the missing villagers have been swept off elsewhere
to counterbalance the presence of the parallel Sth Company in this dimension.

Meanwhile, the Garavaglia have reported that they will drop what biohazard protective gear they have, and
that they have some supplies of a serum that was effective against the plague our dimension’s Nasco used....
but it is well past its shelf-life, and they are going to try and make some more. Kishoshal then said that,
coming from Altair [V (which is the Urthankoid homeworld), he’s had the plague and survived. And so, the
officers began to lay their plans, reassign squads now that the recruits were ready to join us and so on. I
ended up in Alpha squad, with Harris for my buddy, something about the techie being the person he’s most
likely to call for. The squad 2 i/c was Turner, and should Harris decide to wander off - go wildcard, as Turner
put it - I stick with Turner and his buddy Bean, and O’Shaunessy is to go with Harris.

Not long before we were off - Peace said that she had pinpointed the location of one of her witches, and so
Alpha squad went out to capture her. We’d been told that the witches are immune to IR, but very vulnerable
to steel.... so a set of metal handcuffs were found (I am worried about the strange things some of my fellow
Marines carry!) and we set out. By now it was full dark. Harris led the way, me trotting at his heels, as we
headed for the indicated position. Harris halted the squad beside some bushes, and taking just me, went in.
We found the presumed witch, curled up fast asleep. She struggled and complained, but the poor dear didn’t
really have a chance, and we were soon leading her back to base. There, O’Shaunessy took charge of her, and
found somewhere to lock her up. She said she was called Suzanne, lived in the neighbourhood and had been
out collecting herbs; but came over as if she was lying in her teeth. Unfortunately, Peace had gone away for
the time being, so it was difficult to check.

Meanwhile, another patrol had been out, which had came back with the biohazard kit, and I helped Martins
unpack it. About six full protective suits, plus temporary breathing masks that should at least get people out
of a contaminated area. Martins annexed one of the suits for himself, then got a bit tangled over how to put it
on. Gibson, from Special Forces, turned up - don’t know where he came from - and started organising people
into a biohazard squad, insisting that I be part of it. It’s a while since I’ve been seen in respirator and "noddy suit".

Then Calvin was calling for me. "Get that stuff off, Mexal" he said. "I want you to take a patrol out." He
went on to explain that the bad guys were somewhere in the area with an explosive device rigged to spread
the plague, and we had to find them before they set it off. All they knew was that the bomb was somewhere
near a lake - and there were several in the vicinity. I was given two recruits and an area to search, and sent
off.

The recruits - Skeln and Knight - followed me out along a track, towards the area where we’d recovered the
plague box in the first place - and we searched our assigned area thoroughly. Nothing at all - just a small (I
think amphibious) creature which I stepped on. It squeaked and scuttled off, and I guess if it had been sitting
on the path, there can’t have been hordes of bad guys down there! So I took the patrol back in - and arrived
to pandemonium. The entryway to the base was filled with what appeared to be blood-soaked bodies, with
medics all over the place. I took Skeln and Knight, and we went off to stand guard, well out of the way.
Later, I found out that Suzanne the witch had attempted to escape, and had been knifed (fatally) by Fugazi,
who had also managed to stab poor O’Shaunessy. As far as I can tell, the only witness was Gaunt, the
chaplain, who was being very evasive about what had taken place.

Anyway, Knight, Skeln and I stayed on guard for some time, then everybody came out of the base, and we
were called over. One of the other patrols had found the location of the bad guys and their bomb, and we
were off to take them out. Unfortunately, there wasn’t time for me to go back in and get the biohazard suit.
Rats! So off we went, me scuttling along at Harris’ heels as usual. We swept around through all manner of
rough terrain, trees, a swampy bit and some muddy tracks; then came out onto an open track. Dimly seen
ahead, the bad guys appeared to be dug in, and as soon as we emerged they opened fire. Harris shouted
"Charge! Straight through them!" and I dutifully scampered in the designated direction, firing at all the
aggressors I could see. Trouble was, few of the other Marines followed, at least not straight away, and the
opposition targeted in on me. The shots seemed to run together in an overwhelming burst of pain and I
passed out in a heap.

I came round to confusion. Somewhere in a stand of trees, no idea where we were. Dibley was in near panic,
poor Bean had taken a projectile hit, and although Dibley had had the sense to take the shemagh I was
wearing and use it to staunch the bleeding, he still was very badly hurt. Harris was shouting for everybody to
move out, back to base, and I was hauled unceremoniously to my feet even before I’d gotten my head
Straight. As we returned to base, I tried to piece things together, but everybody was concentrating on
movement. By the time we got back, I’d discovered that the others had defeated the bad guys, although as
well as IR they’d come under attack with projectile weapons, and several people had been shot. Once the
Marines had managed to take the aggressors’ position, they’d found all of 16 seconds on the bomb timer, and
so had withdrawn to what they’d hoped was a safe distance, picking up most of the fallen - but omitting to
retrieve me! They'd come back for me after the explosion. Meanwhile, they had a couple of projectile
weapon casualties to treat, one being poor Bean, who did not survive despite Dibley’s efforts to save him. It
was in a subdued state of mind that we went to our beds.

Next morning dawned bright and clear.... and I felt terrible. Disoriented and shivery. I settled down in the
armoury, trying to get on with my work, and was disturbed by Harris. "Are you all right, Mexal?" he asked,
then started shouting for O’Shaunessy. She came over, questioned me, then tried to get me to sit over in one
corner with Oslo and Turner, who were also both feeling ill. Then there was a swirl of mist right in the
entryway, followed by firing. I scurried out, in time to find one aggressor, CMC cammo and a heavy weapon,
and chased him off. Other snipers were around, but I was ordered back inside to repair screens. [ still felt
lousy, and all I really wanted to do was get outside in the fresh air. However, there were enough snipers
outside that there was a continual stream of people with screens to be fixed. At one point I noticed, out of the
corner of my eye, a welcome arrival - Captain Zwalf, back from wherever he’d been since Grant’s World,
and more in his right mind than poor Wellesley had been.

Eventually, I managed to get outside and took a turn at guard duty. Turner was outside too, coughing
horribly, poor dear. I think Oslo had gone to lie down. Snipers were still in the area, more of the parallel 5th
Company, but they were more of a nuisance than a problem. Dibley came round, and tried to order me inside
on medical grounds, then I was relieved and sent in anyway. More screens to armour. Then Zwalf came over.
"Ah, Mexal" he said. "Could I have a word?" Naturally I agreed, although I was a bit puzzled to be led over
to a side passage just off the entryway to the base.

Not as surprised as I then was, however! As soon as the door had closed behind us. Zwalf pushed me back
against the wall, pulled out his sidearm and shot me! At that close range, even the building screen couldn't
damp out the IR, and in a massive flare of sheer agony everything went black.

Next thing I knew, I was flat on my back. Everything was blurred, swimming, spinning. Someone loomed
over me, asking "What happened, Mexal? Who did this?" I could hardly gather my wits, what with the
combined effects of cyclazine, IR exposure reactions and feeling ill anyway; but eventually I managed to say
"Zwalf." More shouting and flurries of movement, O’Shaunessy came into focus, looking worried. She
explained that they had heard a scream, and then found that the door had been wedged shut. Fugazi had taken
a large sword and chopped it down; meanwhile Kishoshal had climbed through the roof space - and nearly
come to grief on some trip wire which had been stretched across the room below. They’>d found me lying
unconscious, but no sign of Zwalf..... who people were beginning to suspect might be from the parallel
dimension mob, not our own. Given the parallel 5th Company’s attitudes, I suspect that this "Zwalf" had
taken the opportunity to attempt to kill me, as a non-human.

Eventually, I gathered enough of my senses to sit and fix screens. I was having trouble concentrating, and
running RVC sequences was far more difficult than usual. It was quite a relief when Harris came by, and
asked if I felt well enough to come out with him to fetch the plague serum, which the Garavaglia people had
sent down in a snowball pod. Somewhere along the line, one of the fellows in plate mail, name of Lancaster,
had turned up, and he came along with the patrol. Odd chap, I think I managed to offend him, but I don’t
know how - something about as we came out I mentioned him to someone else, then found him glaring at
me. Gaunt, somewhere behind, said "You’d better apologise", so I did, although I still don’t know what for!
Turner made some comment about how I lack in tact and diplomacy, left me even more puzzled.

Oh well, off we went. Drop point was beside a lake, we spread out and searched. Someone found the pod,
some aggressors found us, and we fought a running battle back to the base. Just before we got there, I spotted
one sniper lurking in a bush, taking shots at those by the base door. I sneaked up behind him, but just as I
shot him, he turned and got me, and everything went black.

I woke up back in the base, Silver having just administered seven units of resusitant. I still felt extremely
disoriented, and could barely understand what she was saying. Then Gaunt took me by the arm and led me
over to where O’Shaunessy and Mimiannapandawawa were. They’d unpacked the pod, and were now giving
everybody injections of the serum. “Just a little prick" said Mimiannapandawawa, "You'll feel better in half
an hour or so.” By then, just about everybody else had gone out on patrol, and I hung around guarding the
door until they came back. They were accompanied by Peace, who’d got two more of the witches with her.
Everybody came inside, and Harris began to question - threaten, more like - the witches about who they were
and what they were doing. As well as steel, salt causes them pain, and he was waving a handful at them. The
chaplain, standing by taking notes, seemed unconcerned, but I protested about such improper treatment of
prisoners. Harris turned to me. "Mexal, these people have caused many deaths by their actions, and they will
cause more if they aren’t stopped. I don’t really care about their well-being" - then he winked broadly. Aha -
all wind and water - I said "Yes sir" and let the matter drop.

Soon enough, we all set off to the place indicated by Peace as the present location of the glitch. Whatever she
Says about control, I think it is a natural phenomenon, and at most she and her fellows are able to influence
it... but probably not even that. She’s probably a cunning opportunist. Anyway, I ended up right at the back,
guarding Peace and the witches. Ahead, I could hear a battle breaking out as the head of the column arrived,
but by the time we got there, the parallel 5 Company had gone, back into the mists again. We led Peace out
into the clearing, and the mists swirled up, She pushed the witches through, but was reluctant to go herself -
until Harris planted his boot firmly on her stern! I meanwhile made the most of the opportunity to take as
many measurements as I could of the dimensional gate in operation.

We made our way back to base for the inevitable debrief. The missing villagers arrived, somewhat confused
but very glad to be back in their own place again. As far as it can be ascertained, the witches had mesmerised
or somehow gained control over the parallel Nasco and his men, and were using them to achieve their ends.
But my theory that they didn’t actually control the dimensional gate was soon demonstrated by another swirl
of mist, out of which poor Lancaster emerged, looking very confused. Then there was another, and Zwalf
appeared. I stayed well back - after my last encounter with what I’d thought was him! - but this time it did
appear to be "our" one, and not totally in his right mind. He hid behind trees, waved guns and did not appear
ready to trust anybody. He eventually ended up fighting with Turner, O’Shaunessy and Harris, and had to be
subdued.

Not long after this, the dropship collected us and took us back to the Garavaglia. Typically, we then had to
parade. The recruits were passed out as qualified Marines - top marks going to John Doe - and given their
certificates. Then, to my total amazement, I was formally notified that I am on a charge for calling Oslo a
"technophobic nerd"! Ooops. I thought that comment had remained firmly under my breath. Then Fugazi
was told that he was to be placed under open arrest pending court martial for his attack on the witch and
O’Shaunessy. He declined to accept the charge until he’d taken legal advice, so Apone was told to arrest him
and lock him up.

Well, that’s about it. UW medical teams will be sent in to clean up the plague, which hasn’t spread very far,
and to give serum to all affected. As for what the Connet authorities will say, I dread to think. Talked to John
Doe again, too. He said that when he came to write his recruit test paper, the answers just appeared in his
mind, even things he hadn’t been taught. I wonder what his story is, poor dear.

However, the most fascinating thing will be having the time to analyse the readings I’ve taken around the
dimensional gates. It would be nice to be able to work out how to generate them for ourselves. Or at least to
detect them, maybe manipulate or close them. The key may be in the magnetic effects...

All my respects,

Mexal
