John,

That data tap we put in seems to be paying off. We’ve got a second letter home from that Marine called
Mexal.

Decrypt say by the end of September they should have broken the CMC’s rolling encrypt key system for
their normal comms channels, so that just leaves the regular PGP encrypt to crack on each message. I can’t
believe that particular key Mexal used on her mail tho’!!! If only they all made it that easy!!!

Rome wants to buy time on the Geneva AI to crack some other message keys - the budget for that is of
course your decision, but a couple of hundred thousand should get us some good returns.

Happy reading!
Tomas

To Marine Mexal,

Greetings.

Your letter has been safely received, and we are delighted that you are getting on so well. General
Tassach was particularly interested in what you had to say about these “incapacitating radiation” (is that
right?) weapon systems. As instructed by the United Worlds, we have already begun the process of disposing
of all our conventional firearms and replacing them with IR weapons, but yours is the first report of their
actual use that we have had from an independent observer. We do have UW instructors assisting in the
changeover, but they are already convinced of the efficacy of these weapons and so cannot give us an
unbiased view. For your observations, many thanks. They are being studied by the High Command.

We would be interested to learn more of this Brotherhood. I suppose it is to be expected that any body
as large as the United Worlds will have its opponents, and for that matter that they will act against such as the
Marines as symbol of their opposition, but I sincerely trust that they do not spread their activities to
CoedArian. The representative of the United Worlds Intelligence Service here was rather surprised when I
asked him, but said that now I know of the Brotherhood he will prepare me a briefing.

It is good to hear that you have suffered little in the way of prejudice, and I trust that this will continue. Again, if you have any further details on this group, Purity, we would be glad to hear it.

To conclude, you have done well, and are commended. Keep up the good work.

My blessing rest upon you,

To: Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From: Marine Mexal.....but not quite sure where!
Date: 06-06-2493.

Greetings!

I know it’s been a while since I have written to you, but apart from some leave - and you know about that
because I came home! - there has not been much going on. However, that’s a state not enjoyed for long in the
Colonial Marine Corps, and so I am writing now to tell you all about 5th Company’s latest exploits.

We are presently on a planet so recently discovered that it doesn’t even have a name, just some weird code
number that only makes sense to a professor of astrogation! I’m happy to leave it to the drop ship pilot to
deliver us safely. The scouts who discovered it said that it was suitable for habitation, so (following the
normal United Worlds practice) a team from the Colonial Survey Department were sent to examine the place
and give it its formal classification. However, the CSD people encountered some problems, bits of kit going
missing and the like, and so they sent for the Marines. An empty planet suited us well too, there was another
batch of recruits ready for training and there would be plenty of peace and space for them to run around.

We arrived and set up camp without much trouble. The new recruits were given a briefing, and the rest of us
- one or two of my colleagues from my recruit days and a few more experienced people - were sent off to
sweep the area and make sure that it was safe. We’d camped in open grassland near a small wood, which was
full of a fascinating mixture of trees and shrubs. I could have spent the whole day looking at them! As we
wandered around, we found quite a lot of debris left by the survey team, the cases from seismic blast charges,
packaging and all kinds of rubbish. I thought they were supposed to leave the place untouched. Anyway, the
place seemed deserted apart from a few avians and insects, so we returned to camp.

No sooner back than out again, to set up the “Killing Field” exercise for the recruits. I was quite looking
forward to being on the other side! Those of us who were to provide the firepower went off to a suitable site
Sergeant Martins had identified, whilst the rest suitably terrified the recruits and brought them along behind.
When we arrived at the designated site, however, we were startled (to say the least) to be greeted by an
extremely loud explosion! This tured out to be the CSD folk, doing a seismic survey, and they were none
too pleased to see us.

Several of them - a right scruffy crew they were too - came and told us to go away in no uncertain terms.
They all were armed to the teeth, and carrying an assortment of technical devices. I saw an auto analyser, the
sort used for analysing the biochemical composition of plant tissues, then there was the seismic gear and so
on. One explained that they had set their charges, and once they initiated the sequence they couldn’t stop it,
so we had better be elsewhere. Sergeant Martins radioed for Major Gillham, and posted us lot in a defensive
cordon.

Survey team and Marines eyed each other uneasily until the Major arrived. The boss of the survey team,
called Zaylov I think, came along and a blazing row ensued. Zaylov was complaining about our presence on
the planet and the Major countered that firstly they’d asked for us and secondly the CSD briefing had said
that the area we were standing in had been completely surveyed and was available for our use.

Meanwhile, the other members of the survey team were wandering around talking to us. One girl came up to
me and asked in a rather aggressive manner what an elf was doing in the Marines. She looked, I’m not sure,
maybe horrified, when I said it was a good way of getting to see lots of planets and enjoy the diversity of
plant life. She backed off hastily when I asked if they’d found any interesting plants, leaving me a bit
puzzled. Once she’d gone I pricked up my ears again, Zaylov was moaning about the mess we’d made....bit
much really, considering the amount of their mess we’d already found. I said as much, and got a glare and
“Can it, Marine” from the Major.

Eventually they went away, grumbling, and we were left to get on. The area picked for the “Killing Field”
was near where they'd been blasting and there were a number of curious holes, small ones, looked like
they'd been hand-dug, near the bases of a few trees. Not what you’d expect from blasting. By now the
recruits had arrived, and were hanging around looking apprehensive. Martins and a Corporal soon had us
organised and the fun was on.

The first batch through were pretty much of a shambles, each one scampering about on its own. The next lot
were a bit better apart from several who decided to run straight through a bog. The final group had actually
made some attempt to get themselves organised, and started out well....or in other words, they got me! What
was worrying was the way they came bounding up the hill shouting “Let’s kick the bastard to make sure he’s
dead”. Fortunately they didn’t, but made enough noise to draw the fire of the rest of the Marines and they
were soon picked off.

Still, they all made a valiant effort. We all went back, talking together, telling them about Marine life and
answering their questions. Not always truthfully, of course - like telling them that being promoted depending
on things like how much you drank and your vocabulary of bad language! When we got back to the camp,
they carried on with their training - much the same as mine, not so long ago - and we lot were treated to a
lecture on the skills required for the Med-Tech-4 qualification. By now I know this stuff backwards, but still
haven't had a chance to take the test. Not that it is the direction I’m interested in, I’ve decided to aim for
being an armourer and learning as much as I can about all the APDs (anti-personnel devices, you know, trip
flares, grenades and similar booby-traps), but any knowledge is useful.

Later on, some of the survey team turned up in our camp. They were trying to scrounge food, and several -
who were acting very oddly - were offering us pieces of some fruit that they said was native to the planet and
very pleasant to eat. To add to the confusion, one - the girl I’d talked to earlier - was rushing around saying
that on the contrary the fruit was poisonous. I got talking with her again, and discovered that she was the
team botanist. Odd though, she didn’t have any idea what the active agent in the fruit was, or much
information about it, although she claimed to have analysed it thoroughly. Then she started saying that she
had no samples and she’d be glad if we’d find her some, but also that she’d lost her test rig. Sergeant Martins
was everywhere telling us under no circumstances to try eating this fruit, whatever it was. I tried to get a
closer look but didn’t get very far. One of them, a long haired male - they were all human by the way - was in
quite a state, he kept muttering about seeing blue rabbits....and then appeared to be very puzzled by my ears!

They finally went away, and Major Gillham called a meeting. He said that he was sure that something odd
was going on, there was more to this survey team than met the eye. He’d inquired of Area Command, and
they had said that it appeared we had the right people, although CSD were pretty lax about security, and
certainly they were carrying more weapons than they should have had - something about they were
authorised to have one dart gun, firing tranquilliser darts, and a single IR weapon in case of real trouble.
We’d certainly seen more than that on them!

I mentioned the botanist’s odd behaviour, and that she was claiming to have lost her auto analyser, which she
had been holding when we’d met them earlier. There was some debate as to what was happening, were they
maybe attempting to extract and market whatever sort of hallucinatory drug was in this plant. Somebody
came up with the nasty idea that if they had a dart gun they might try putting this drug on the darts - I think
most of us agreed with the Major’s comment “I wish you’d kept that idea to yourself”. Given the debates
between the members of the survey team it was possible that they weren’t all involved. Also, it was fairly
odd that they wouldn’t tell us where their camp was.

Anyway, it was decided to be wary, to watch them if they came round again and to see if we could find any
of these fruits. In the meantime, we posted sentries round the camp. I had a root around and found that they’d
dropped quite a few seeds from the fruit, which I picked up and put in a sample bag (my early days as a
botanist were coming in handy!).

A group of us set out to have a scout around, and to look for some of the fruits. Apparently they were some
kind of “groundnut”, or at least that’s what the survey team botanist said. More a fruit than a nut, as far as I
could see from the structure, but no matter. We went across the fields and into the woods - the same route
we'd followed in our initial sweep of the area - but just into the woods we came across the strangest sight.

There were four humanoid figures, ape-like really, dressed in scraps of clothing and digging at the ground
with sticks. They were quite agitated by our approach, and beat their sticks on the ground, capering around
and grunting. The Major tried firing a few bursts of IR over their heads, which had no effect at all. He was
getting rather worried until the rest of us noticed that they were wearing MS-CIV screens (that’s the civilian
version, not as good, of the screen system we have in our helmets) hidden amongst the scraps of clothing.
Someone tried sign language, but they just didn’t pay any attention. I tried moving a bit nearer, picked up a
stick and began to imitate what they were doing. They looked confused, and one began to drool.

Then the Major ordered us to chase them off, so that we could examine the area they were poking about in.
They seemed to use the beating of sticks against the ground as a threat gesture, so I tried imitating that. It
certainly had an effect, they started throwing lumps of earth, twigs and stones at us. Sergeant Martins
shouted something about “Stop that, Marine Mexal, and I mean NOW!”, someone fired a few more bursts of
IR, this time right at them......then they charged, straight at me! The drooling one looked as if it was about to
hit me over the head with its stick, so I took evasive action, right into a clump of plants which stung (local
version of a nettle, I think) while they halted again and rooted under the tree beside me. They grabbed out
what looked very much like the hallucinogenic fruit and then they raced off, screaming and waving their
sticks. To the Major’s disgust nobody managed to stop them or get the fruit, and they got away.

We all began to root around ourselves, and eventually unearthed another specimen. I got a good look at it. As
far as I could tell, it was some kind of parasitic organism, certainly the tree it was under had died. That or it
was one of these survival mechanisms some plants use - when conditions are bad they basically put their life
force into a storage mode until they improve. Someone had a visual recorder, and made a comprehensive
record of the thing.

The Major decided to continue the patrol, and we went deeper into the forest, exploring some of the trails
that we hadn’t looked at before. We saw little of interest, just recruits making attempts at camouflaging
themselves - although I did notice a high proportion of parasitic plant life forms - and eventually retraced our
steps. As we were going back along the forest margin towards the camp, we heard the unmistakable sound of
IR weapons being discharged somewhere nearby in the forest. The question was, who? The recruits were
back at camp, running round the grassland in some vague semblance of field formations, the CSD should not
have had the weapons and we knew where we were! And at least one, probably more, heavy weapon was in
use.

Just on the edge of the forest there was a narrow stream, and beyond that the ground rose quite steeply. The
firing seemed to be coming from somewhere up there, and so several people went up to investigate. The rest
of us stayed on the fringes, ready to provide covering fire. Someone went to get additional support in the
shape of a squad of recruits. As far as we could tell there was a running battle going on, then we came under
fire as well. Various figures could be seen flitting through the trees, and we on the edge we shouting to the
rest telling them where they were going. Those who had gone over the stream were soon taking quite a few
hits, and the recruits were sent in to provide cover while those who had gone down were retrieved. The
medics were kept pretty busy. The Major went down at one point, but was soon back up and shouting as
usual!

Eventually, whoever it was in the forest went off, and we regrouped and returned to camp. As we left we
noticed a strange figure standing and watching - all in black, heavily armed, with a camouflage head
covering and wearing a MS-CIV screen. No face, just some kind of blank metal were a face should have
been. When we approached this figure, it made off at a great rate. Odd, it didn’t seem to run, it just moved
very quickly. Someone told me later that this thing, nicknamed The Black Robot, has been seen two or three
times, on different planets. It just observes, has never shown any hostility, and always makes off quickly
when approached. It was one of the figures that I had observed - maybe it had come into contact with
whoever else was running around up there, and that had caused the firing we had heard initially.

Anyway, we got back to camp. The recruits were full of excitement, the Major was burning up the
communications channels trying to find out what was going on, and we got posted out on guard duty. I found
a nice shady spot and settled down, on the side well away from all the action. Somewhere off in the distance,
there was a loud explosion. Those on that side of the camp said that there was series of bleeps lasting thirty
seconds before the bang. When they went to investigate, they found the remains of one of the ape-creatures
and assorted debris which appeared to be some kind of weapon. Worse, the markings on what was left of the
weapon indicated that it belong to the Colonial Marine Corps, although it didn’t look like any of our issue
weapons. Odd. The Major was soon back on the communications system.

At one point, that botanist turned up again, and had a massive argument with the Major. He said that he was
quite frankly of the opinion that something odd was going on and that he was seriously considering
impounding all their specimens if not actually arresting the survey team. She stormed off in a fury.

In the early evening we were all called together, fed rather earlier than normal and then told to sit down and
listen to an incoming communication from Area Command. Age, maybe, but these desk-jockeys look
younger every time! This one - looked more like a secretary than a member of the Marines high command! -
said that two experimental weapons had been stolen recently, and it seemed that they had turned up here.
Maybe the people who had stolen them had been looking for a quiet place to test them before going on the
market. The identity of the thieves was not known, but the likelihood is Nu Phoenicians. (One of the others
had said something about he thought the people we’d been fighting earlier had Nu Phoenician accents, not
that I’d recognise one!) The explosion that had obliterated an ape-creature - which incidentally had not been
reported by the Survey team - was probably one of the weapons self-destructing. Apparently that’s done by
overloading the power supply unit and the whole thing goes off bang. Anyway, they wanted the remaining
one back. Being an experimental weapon, there is a remote deactivation device that can be used to switch it
off...and make it blow up if need be. They had arranged for one to be dropped for us, and would send the
necessary information to make it work. In code, they thought that the transmission was being monitored.

Once the briefing was over, the Major got to work, planning the operation. He’d been given both the drop
zone location and the probable site of the thieves’ base, needless to say, uncomfortably close to one another.
Everyone was divided into three groups, recruits and trained Marines alike, one group was to go and retrieve
the data safe the deac unit was arriving in while the rest were to go and keep the enemy busy and provide
back-up for the snatch squad. I was in the snatch team, under the command of Sergeant Martins....who took
one look round and announced that I was going on point! My buddy was Chaos, just like last time.

Soon enough, we set off, with me in the lead. I’d found myself a long stick to probe ahead with but all I
found with it was a very indignant rabbit! We went for quite a way through the woods without incident. As
we reached the far side, where we had to cross an area of open ground to a wooded knoll which was the drop
zone, I noticed a few people moving around and halted the squad. How they didn’t see me I’ll never know -
although the rest were in cover I had to rely on remaining still to avoid attention - but eventually they moved
off. “Right”, Sergeant Martins whispered from behind, “We’ll run from here. Get going!”.

Running has never been my strong point, and on these high gravity worlds I am less than impressed with the
concept, so I just put my head down and charged. Naturally, that’s when I found the trip wire - the hard way!
Just a large stun grenade, I think, but I was moving fast enough to escape its effects, and the rest had spread
out so it didn’t affect them either. We charged straight across the grassland towards the knoll. There was
some firing from behind, I think that the enemy had intended to stun and then ambush us, but had been
thwarted by our headlong rush!

Once we reached the knoll, everybody began looking for the data safe. I guessed that as it had been dropped
from low orbit, it would likely be caught in the trees and sure enough there it was, with three light sticks
taped to it so that we wouldn’t miss it. I pointed it out to Sergeant Martins, and he and I looked it over.
Seemed OK to me, then Martins said “It may well be booby trapped. You take it down while we stay well
back.” So nice to be loved, I thought, and reached up for it. Glad to say it came away with no untoward
effect (there again, I hadn’t expected anything, after all, we were supposed to collect it!), and Martins
immediately ordered us to move out.

We had been supposed to await the arrival of the back up squads, but there had been neither sight or sound of
them, nor anything on the radio. I wanted to remove the light sticks - no point in traversing enemy-held
territory proclaiming to all and sundry that I had the thing - but Martins didn’t want to wait so I stripped
them off as I ran and stuffed them in my pocket. We went across a deep hollow and through some bushes
into long grass where we settled down to wait.

Some movement was visible over in the forest, which lay between us and the camp, but there was no way of
knowing who it was and they didn’t come any closer. There was no sounds of firing, no radio messages,

nothing. Eventually, we decided to return to camp by skirting around the end of the forest into the grassland
beyond, which we were able to do without incident. The camp was deserted. We posted guards all around,
put the box in the main camp safe and tried to raise the rest on the radio. No joy, and eventually Martins
decided to go out and look. Chaos and I stayed behind to guard the camp, not that we could have done more
than run (or die heroically) if the enemy had arrived.

It seemed a long time later when the radios came alive. Both Martins’ lot and the main body were on their
way back. When they were all in, and some hot pies were being passed around, we found out that the Major
and his men had come under heavy fire from the outset, and had virtually stalled out there. Apparently they’d
met a nasty remote-controlled sentry gun, which had pinned down about thirty of them before they’d been
able to neutralise it. There had been quite a lot of damage taken, but everybody had survived, I am glad to
Say.

The night was quiet, if a bit edgy. In the morning, the recruits had to sit their written tests. Some of us had to
invigilate, some were sent out on guard and for some reason I didn’t get any job at all, so I curled up in the
sun and went to sleep. Next thing I knew the corporal organising the defences was poking me with his toe.
“Get up” he said, “I think we have a contact.” I got up and had a look around. The people off towards the far
bit of forest were looking off into the trees. The corporal ran off to see what was happening. I watched him
as he talked to some of the sentries, then he turned and called me over. I went, and squatted down beside
him. “What’s up, Corp?” I asked.

“You come with me, act as my buddy” he said, and set off on a quick tour of the sentries, who were reporting
quite a lot of movement in the forest but no more. Then he went back to report to the Major. He said that the
sentries should try to avoid a fight, just keep an eye on what was happening. Naturally, by the time we got
back to them they were under fire! There were quite a few figures in the trees, moving around and taking
pot-shots. Most of us took a few hits, but nobody was knocked out at this point.

Then that corporal decided to take the fight to them, and the next thing I knew I was being sent up the
hillside through the trees after them, with the rest following me. As I went forward, concentrating on the
bushes ahead, I became aware of someone behind poking me and whispering my name. It turned out to be
one of the medics, who’d spotted from the external read-out that my screen was on the verge of failure, so he
run the screen repair program quickly and got it sorted out. Useful, that!

The running battle went on for quite a while, as we and the enemy played tag through the trees. At one point
I heard one of the enemy say something like “Let’s do a pincer manoeuvre, just as Nasco taught us”, and
then I came under heavy fire (I think it may have been the stolen heavy weapon) and my screen went down.
So did I, out cold. When I came round I had landed between two very prickly bushes, and the medics were
complaining bitterly about having to climb through them! They were also moaning that I’d needed eight
units of resusitant drugs. As if it was my fault! Medics!

Eventually, the enemy decided that they’d had enough, and ran off. We returned to the camp, and found that
while we’d been away, the transmission with all the coded information had come in. There was a whole lot
of encrypted stuff, which for some reason got handed to me, which contained the information necessary to
open the data safe we’d retrieved the night before. Mostly letter and number substitution codes, which I find
extremely easy to crack although some of them posed questions that I for one didn’t know the answer to.
Fortunately the other Marines were able to come up with the right answers.

Let’s see - you like puzzles, so I'll see if I can remember a bit of it. The transmission began:-

OLEL DLQP PYECJ NZOP DSPPE

PLNS DPNETZY XFDE MP OPNZOPO LYO ESP TYDECFNETZYD QZWWZHPO EZ OPCTGP ESP
PYECJ NZOP. DAPPO TD ZQ ESP PDDPYNP LD ECLYDXTDDTZY DPNFCTEJ NLYYZE MP
LDDFCPO.
 
By guessing that the first line was “DATA SAFE ENTRY CODE SHEET”, the rest came out as “EACH
SECTION MUST BE DECODED AND THE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWED TO DERIVE THE ENTRY
CODE. SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE AS TRANSMISSION SECURITY CANNOT BE ASSURED”

Then there were four sections, each with a different code, which when decoded and the question answered
gave a number. These four numbers were the combination to the data safe. Inside the thing, we found the
deac unit and an envelope with the key to yet another number code. The Major said that he’d also received a
four-digit number which when translated using this code would give the number that had to be entered into
the deac unit.

The CMC seems to love these code games. So do I.....1 wonder if an eidetic memory helps? Does with
substitution codes, once I have grasped the way it’s done I can just read it off. And, as you can see from the
above sample, remember it later!

SO, plans were then announced for an all-out assault on the enemy position with the aim of getting that
weapon back, or at least destroying it. We were going to mount a wide sweep through the forest towards their
camp, two sections in arrowhead side by side and the rest following up behind. Guess who was point man on
one of the leading sections. Yes - me again!

To begin with, it was all very peaceful (apart from our route leading through what seemed to be every
Stinging plant in the entire forest!). Then there were several explosions from direction in which the other
section had gone, and we soon ended up charging through the trees with no more thought for stealth.
Eventually we came upon some of the enemy forces. I led the way round in a flanking attack, got in a few
shots then took heavy fire myself and passed out in a heap.

I came round struggling.....the medics had used that “kick-start your central nervous system” stuff again. It
tastes no better, and hurts just as much, as it did the last time, but at least I know what it is now. (Called
cyclazine, by the way, and if you meet it avoid it!) Just as I was getting back to my feet several enemy came
running past. I think the cyclazine has a bit of an untoward effect on me (maybe the elven metabolism reacts
a bit oddly to it) because I found myself charging after them, firing furiously. At least one went down. I’m
not usually quite that much of a head-banger in combat, I prefer to snipe.

Anyway, a loud bang in the distance marked the end of that weapon, and we eventually wiped out all the
enemy, and made our way back to camp. Later on, the survey team turned up, and the botanist was arrested.
She was none too pleased at being handcuffed and dragged off! The rest were told that they, and their
samples, were coming back with us on the drop ship and would be returned to the Colonial Survey
Department for investigation.

That’s about it really. We held a passing-out parade for the new recruits....and heard some of the gems they’d
written in their test. I think the best was the answers to the question “What do you do if your buddy goes
down?” which received the replies “Cry” and “Take the blame”. (For the non-military among you, the real
answer is shout for a medic.)

Not sure when I'll next be writing. Rumour (which abounds in the Marines, of course) has it that we are to
get some specialist training in surveillance and communications. That should be fun. (Especially if they

extend surveillance to include sabotage!!)

All my respects,

Mexal
