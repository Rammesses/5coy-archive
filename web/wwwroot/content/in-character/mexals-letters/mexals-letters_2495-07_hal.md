John,

The letters home just keep on coming... Maybe we should give Mexal a bonus!!!

Since as far as I know we don't have any holdings on Hal, I've not flagged any follow-ups to this.

Tomas

To: The Right Reverend Elder Belzakath and all my friends back home.
From:  ‘TechSgt. Mexal, Hal.
Date: 18-07-2495.

Greetings!

Since that deep-space encounter with the Marie Celesta, all has been fairly quiet. The Garavaglia was taken
into dock and the refit finished, while we were left kicking our heels without much to do at CMC HQ.
Housenens and Arnold were collected as soon as we arrived by a medical team from Haines-Worthy
Starways... and there's a rumour going round that they never reached their destination. Yet another strange
thing about the whole affair. The other evening, Turner (who wasn't with us), Krinly and I were chatting, and
came to the conclusion that it is extremely unusual for one jump ship to pop out into real-space that close to
another. As Krinly put it, about the only way you could manage that on purpose is to follow the other ship's
jump sequence exactly... as usual, one begins to suspect that there is a great deal that they are not telling us!

You've probably seen the latest Interstellas, it looks like I am being blamed for the destruction of the Marie
Celesta. I suppose that it is inevitable, although I'm not too sure just what I could have done to avert the
explosion. Pity Turner hadn't been around, he's the best CompTech in the Company, and might have been
able to do something. Perhaps if a proper inquiry is held the truth may come out, perhaps not. I've heard that
both during and after the incident, Haines-Worthy have been extremely reticent, even withholding informa-
tion that possibly might have enabled us to save the Marie Celesta.

So, once the Garavaglia's refit was completed, a small squad of us - thirteen Marines in total - were ordered
aboard. We had no idea where we were off to, and it wasn't until the final emergence into realspace that
Zwalf, the senior officer present (and restored to his right mind since Groombridge, I am delighted to say)
called us together and said that we had arrived in orbit around Hal. You may have heard of the place - 5
Company visited it last year whilst I was on leave, back home with you. Then, they had been sent on an
undercover mission to assist one of the members of the Hal government in a convoluted operation thought up
by the fevered minds of UW Intelligence. Hal isn't a member of the United Worlds, and has a slave-based
economy (disgusting thought). This member of the government had contacted UWI, and said that if he was
given assistance to quell a slave revolt, he would gain political credibility which he would then use to have
Slavery abolished. Incredible as it may seem, UWI fell for this and sent in the Marines. Of course, the
politician was lying, and 5 Company ended up in a planetary jail!

Zwalf explained that a major rebellion was now occurring on Hal, and that the UW had decided to offer f
assistance - in the shape of training and supplies - to the rebels. Our task was to deliver three training officers
and some equipment to three of the rebel groups (they are apparently very fragmented, and don't get on too
well with each other), and to collect some data which the rebels had offered to gather for the UW. He also
announced that he'd been appointed Acting Major, but would not be accompanying us, he would be visiting
some other rebels in the area, and that we would be under the command of Lieutenant Calvin, who was
promoted Acting Captain. The training officers were introduced: Lieutenants Churchill, Winters and Knapp.

The Hal governmental forces were to be regarded as opposition, and we could engage them freely, in fact it
was essential that word did not get out of our presence, as they would probably send in reinforcements if
they knew that we were there. We were told that they are a unified force, using naval ranks and organised in
cohorts and legions.... but not particularly well-trained or effective.

So, we got ourselves organised. I issued weapons and screens to all personnel, and we were grouped into
three squads. Schwartzkopf, as Acting Corporal, was placed in charge of Alpha Squad, with Riccotanini,
Krinly and Deacon (a new transfer in); Bravo Squad was commanded by Turner, with Martins, Doe and me
in it; and the HQ Squad would consist of Calvin, Oslo, Mimiannapandawawa and Fugazi. It was announced
that Gina Riccotanini has just passed her Med-Tech 4, and that Fugazi had been passed as fit for duty by the
psychs, and would continue to serve with us until his Court Martial.

We were to be dropped in three packets, and would meet up with each other and with a representative of the
rebels after we landed. The idea was not to attract attention to our presence. Each group took some of the
equipment that was to be delivered, and the training officers went with HQ Squad. Bravo went down second,
and a rougher ride in a dropship it is harder to imagine. Didn't recognise the pilot, but we were all wishing
that it had been Corporal Hunter at the controls.

Once on the ground, we made our way to the rendezvous and soon met up with the rest of the Marines and a
representative of the Freemen for Freedom, who was to show us to a place where we could camp in relative
safety. On the way to the site, we skirmished with a four-man patrol of Hal government forces, who ended up
dead in a ditch. Once settled, we posted guards and some food was prepared, which we ate in relays. A figure
was spotted in the distance, staggering out of the forest. Bravo were sent out to bring him in, he turned out to
be an escaped slave who had been badly beaten. The only name he seemed to have was "64", and as you can
imagine his life until now had been grim in the extreme. He was given medical attention and food, and we
offered to introduce him to the rebels, as he expressed a desire to join in the fight for freedom. All that
remained for him, if he went back, was to be executed.

The Freemen for Freedom (Triple F, as they called themselves) contact told us that the other groups were the
Hal Freedom Army and the Slaves for Freedom. Both these groups had been informed of our presence, and
would be sending in their own people to collect their share of the supplies, and a training officer apiece. In
the meantime, he gathered up his own share, and went off, promising to return later with the promised data.

Not long afterwards, four people in dark brown uniforms arrived. They announced that they were "Slave
Security" and inquired if we had seen an escaped slave for whom they were looking. They were invited in -
"64" was tucked out of sight in a tent - and Calvin and I circled around behind the leaders. He signalled a
count to me, and we shot them simultaneously. As they fell unconscious, the other two - both female - were
taken prisoner. Bravo Squad were directed to take charge of the prisoners, then Martins gave Calvin a note
which had been passed to him by the leader..... stating that he was a UWI infiltrator! Ooops. It wasn't clear
whether the whole lot were in on this, or just him, so the unconscious pair were resuscitated and kept apart,
as were the two conscious prisoners. After the agent had had a chat with Calvin, the group were sent on their
way, with many apologies for the "misunderstanding".

The guards then reported that they thought they'd seen light reflecting off something in the forest, possibly a
telescope. I tried looking through mine, but couldn't see anything. A small patrol set out, and almost
immediately encountered a lone individual, who was soon unconscious on the floor. I was directed to search
him, and found ID showing that he was a member of Hal government forces, a Recon specialist at that.
Calvin ordered me to strip the body and dump it in a nearby thorn bush - guess the idea was that if it were
found, the death would be attributed to rebel forces.

Voices were then heard, and two figures - in civilian dress but armed - approached. I was nearest, and chal-
lenged them. They didn't want to say who they were, but eventually admitted to being from SFF - the Slaves
for Freedom group. They went into the base, and Martins and I were left as an outpost for a very long time.
Each time Martins called in on his radio, we were told to stand fast. At last, the SFF left - taking "64" with
them - and some time later we were called in as well.

Calvin announced that we would pose as members of the Hal government forces to anyone except the rebels,
and gave orders that we should say as much when challenged. I took him aside and said that I wasnt
prepared to lie, but would remain silent - that's bad enough. I think he accepted that, although I don't think
many of the Marines understand the CoedArianese ethic that well.

I wandered off to get a drink, and was called back by Turner, who wanted me to send a radio message to the
Garavaglia - saying that all the training officers and supplies had been delivered and that we were ready for
pick-up. I was about to ask "What about the data we're meant to collect" when Turner said "Get on with it,
Mexal" and chased me away, so off to the uplink. As I expected, the reply was “Have you got all that data
yet?"

The rest of the afternoon was spent in and around our camp, making occasional sallies forth to deal with
small patrols of Hal regulars, who all joined the previous members of the Hal army in various ditches. Krinly
was heard to mention that the planet would soon be suffering an outbreak of cholera and dysentery if this
went on! Late on that afternoon, the Triple F man came along again - pleased as anything in his new cammo
gear which had been in the supplies they'd received - with a couple of data disks. He was able to give Calvin
the arrangements for meeting with the other two groups to get their data, both tomorrow.

During a quiet moment, Mimiannapandawawa came over and said that she was running a Med-Tech 4 course
and wanted me to take it. She insisted, despite my protests that I don't want to be a medic, and prefer dealing
with things I can mend with a screwdriver, so I joined Turner, Doe and Krinly and listened to her holding
forth about the various resusitant drugs and how to use them. Not much new - I have made sure that I knew
what was going on already, usual information-gathering curiosity, but it was quite interesting nonetheless.

As it was getting dark, and supper was being prepared, the Slave Security team arrived again. Their leader
(the UWI agent) asked for a word with Calvin, the others decided to make themselves a hot drink. They were
most annoyed when they picked the wrong boiler and got cold water in their coffee! Much laughter, and
comments of “They should have asked instead of helping themselves". Once they'd gone, however, Calvin
told us that as soon as we'd eaten we would have to break camp and move out, as our position had been
compromised and indications were that the Hal army intended to attack. Oslo and Fugazi volunteered to set
up an OP, and look for an opportunity to snipe at any aggressors, and a rendezvous was arranged for later.
Meanwhile, Alpha Squad were posted on guard and Bravo were detailed to strike camp.

So, there I was entangled in bits of loose tent - it was windy and once unpegged the material was everywhere
- when the arrival of the Hal army was heralded by heavy weapons fire and the lights of an APC. The order
to drop everything and go was given, but I began to worry as I took several hits whilst disentangling myself,
and could see the rest of the Marines leaving fast. If I went down, it didn't look like they'd stop. Fortunately, I
managed to get clear, although I was about the last out. We went a short distance into the forest and set up an
ambush, but they didn't follow up and we soon moved out. On our way, we were met by a member of the
SFE, who led us to another position which we could use as a base - he didn't think that this one was known to
the government forces.

Once we were settled in, he told us that the government forces had captured several SFF members and their
radio equipment. He knew where they were, and enlisted our help in mounting an attack. Calvin ordered a
fighting patrol, everyone was to take part. So off we went, through the woods towards a more open area. On
the way, we met Oslo, who was rather worried as he'd become separated from Fugazi and had no idea where
he had gotten to. Out in the middle of the open area there was a small hill with a clump of trees at the top,
this was where the enemy were camped - we could see some of them moving around. We formed an ex-
tended line and approached, slowly and cautiously.... they can't have been keeping a very good lookout as we
had gotten quite close before they opened fire. Then we charged, yelling and firing ourselves. Just as I
reached the clump of trees I came under fire from a heavy weapon and passed out - the last thing I remember
was a very strong smell of animal droppings as I hit the ground.

When I opened my eyes - to Martins making his notes and Turner making a caustic comment about "Trust
Mexal to need eight units of resusitant” - the position had been taken, all the government troops killed and
the prisoners and radio equipment recovered. We made our way back to our new base, and were extremely
glad to find that Fugazi had made his own way to it, and was quite safe. I'm not sure what the rest did, but I
was absolutely exhausted and crawled into my shelter unit immediately. (Throughout this mission, I found
myself tiring easily, perhaps the last aftereffects of the hard radiation from Groombridge.)

Next morning began with the SFF contact arriving again. He confirmed the arrangements for our meetings
with his people and the Hal Freedom Army to collect data. He also said that Churchill, one of the training
officers, had been killed in a skirmish. He'd only just gone when a disgusting sight came into view - three
people leading a group of slaves, all tied together. Pretending to be government forces, we managed to get
around them, then Calvin called "Where's Mario?” (our signal for a surprise attack) and the slavers were all
taken out. The slaves took to their heels at once, even before I could untie them. The bodies of the slavers
ended up in the nearest ditch. Then we were attacked by three members of the Hal army, who soon joined the
Slavers in the ditch.

Calvin was just issuing his orders for a fighting patrol to sweep the woods, and to make the arranged
meetings to pick up data, when a large force of Hal government troops were seen approaching. Deciding that
this camp too was compromised, he ordered us to move out at once. We patrolled through the forest, and met
four Hal troops on patrol, who we engaged - shouting “Die, rebel scum". For some reason, this didn't strike
them as strange, they didn't attempt to identify themselves or find out who we were, just fought back. Three
were taken out, and one was captured. I was sent to search him, then Calvin questioned him - got unit details
and was told that his commander was an Ensign John Jones. Just then, the others reported more troops, so
Calvin pulled out a knife and cut the prisoner's throat.

The skirmishing continued, alternating with attempts to give the impression that we were part of the Hal
government forces. Most of the time, the real government forces didn't seem to care, and opened fire
anyway. We pulled a snap ambush on one group, who were moving along a track with a captured slave.
During this fight, I sustained several hits and passed out in a heap.

When I regained consciousness, I was somewhere else entirely - very confusing. Not helped by what seemed
like more than the usual effects of cyclazine. When my vision cleared, I found that the person holding me
down was none other than Cyberknight. A welcome sight, he had somehow been left behind when 5
Company were last on Hal and had been surviving rough ever since. He had several untreated injuries, and
was complaining about malfunctions in his central processor, but was basically in reasonable shape, and
pleased to see us again. Gina came over, and told me that as Mimiannapandawawa was elsewhere in the
forest, she'd been swamped with calls for treatment - particularly as both officers and Turner had all been
down at one time or another - and every time she'd gotten round to me, more urgent calls had come. Turner
had been badgering her to do something about me, so she'd administered diazamorphite, thus leaving me
stabilised but unconscious until she'd had time to deal with me. Meanwhile, the whole party had moved
position several times, and had also met up with the Hal Freedom Army contact, who had brought further
drug supplies and Cyberknight as well as the promised data. Eventually, she'd had time to treat me, which !
called for a double dose of cyclazine, the only way to bring someone round from diazamorphite.

The HFA contact was able to lead us to a safe - we hoped! - place where we could pause for food and a rest.
As we approached this pace, at the edge of the forest, we could hear voices. Peering out, we saw two
uniformed members of Slave Security (not the UWI agent, this time) with a female slave, who they appeared
to be ill-treating. Muttering something about using bluff to deal with them, the HFA man strode towards
them, demanding to know what they were doing. Turner wanted to wait and see what happened, but Calvin
followed out, with me on his heels, and the rest of the Marines followed.

The bluff appeared to be based around the slave being the property of the HFA man, and him complaining
about the way she had been treated. Her hands were tied, and she had a black eye, amongst other bruises and
contusions. I circled round behind the Slave Security men, then one of them began to argue with the HFA
man, something about “You know the penalties for aiding escaped slaves" - at which point the HFA man
delivered a roundhouse swing that left the Slave Security man out cold on the ground. He grabbed the other
one, threatened him and ordered him to leave, taking his unconscious colleague with him.... poor chap
seemed glad to be able to get away.

I went over to the slave, who was kneeling on the ground looking terrified. She barely moved even as I
untied her hands and tried to comfort her, wouldn't even raise her eyes. I called Martins over to dress her
injuries, and we asked her if she would like to join one of the groups of freedom fighters. By this time, the
HFA man had gone, and some food had been prepared. Just as we finished eating, a couple of members of
the SFF arrived, including "64", and the female agreed to go with them.

Once they'd gone, we moved out back into the forest and continued patrolling. Eventually we met our final
contact, who supplied the promised data and said that all the rebels were very concerned about the
probability that they had been infiltrated. The Hal government forces had switched from their normal aggres-
sive patrols of the area to deliberate targeted attacks on rebel bases. Their theory was that not all of the
escaped slaves who had joined them were genuine, that some were spying for the government. He also
showed us a safe harbour where we were able to take a short break, resting in turns whilst the officers tried to
work out where we should go next. There was some confusion about the precise location of the site where
the drop ship was to collect us - guess it's always a mistake to let an officer have a map! Turner, who's a good
Comptech, also found time to have a look at Cyberknight's central processor, and said that some of the
interface protocols were corrupted. No wonder the poor dear was having a bit of trouble with his cyberhand.

The next few hours were spent wandering through the forests. Given the aggressive actions of the Hal
government forces, who also had aircraft overflying the area, staying in one place for any length of time did
not seem to be a good idea. This way, we only once saw any of them, making their way along a track, leading
what appeared to be a couple of prisoners. For no apparent reason, an attack was not called, although we
were in a very good position from which to bounce them.

Then news came through - not quite sure how - that the government forces had captured the two remaining
training officers. Although we had now gotten all the data, and were just awaiting pick up, it was decided
that we really ought to attempt to rescue them - despite Oslo arguing that it was more important to get the
data off planet. So the Garavaglia was contacted and a new extraction arranged, near the location of the
government forces, and off we went again, through the forest, over an open space and into a further forest.
We spread out and began to search, then the leading elements (myself included) came under fire from several
heavy weapons and the assault was on. We charged in, exchanging fire with several hostiles.... I'm not sure of
the course of the skirmish as I went down under the concentrated fire of a couple of the opposition.

When I came round, I was still groggy and confused, couldn't focus properly or get my balance. Gina was
telling me something about she wanted me to keep an eye on Turner, who was having a bad reaction to IR
exposure, but there wasn't much I could do about it, I could hardly stand straight myself. Then more aggres-
sors came in, I took a couple more hits, but - aiming mostly by ear - fired back. They went off, or were taken
out, I'm not sure which, then Mimiannapandawawa came along and insisted that I reset my screen. Needless
to say, this is the point that the screen generator power cell decided to fail.... and all the spares I normally
carry had already been used. A frantic search for a fresh cell finally found one, with Mimiannapandawawa
shouting at everybody that they must not open fire while I was unscreened.

By now Turner was fully recovered, and I could see straight too. The two training officers had been
recovered, but both of them were well out of their skulls, high on some kind of hallucinogenic drug. Fugazi,
needless to say, promptly announced that he'd like some! They managed to tell us that the government forces
had videotaped them “confessing to everything", but we could not find any tapes, it appeared that they had
already been collected and taken away. By now, it was under half an hour to the drop ship's arrival, so we
made our way back to the open area where we were due to be picked up. There was a wooded hill in the
middle, and a single figure could be seen up there. A couple of people went over, the rest of us providing
covering fire then following up. The fellow ran off to the forest on the far side, leaving us to take possession
of the hilltop to await the drop ship's arrival.

We could see movement down in the forest, and it became apparent that some more of the Hal government
forces were down there. One or two people fired at them, but it was at extreme range. Then Fugazi charged,
shouting a battlecry from his native Avelonia. Alpha Squad followed up, but then Mimiannapandawawa
decided to join in and raced into the fray, shouting. I took off after her, she was running straight towards the
government troops, unlike Fugazi and the others who were attempting to sneak along the forest edge. Turner
and the rest of Bravo followed.

We reached a gate, which Mimiannapandawawa wrestled open and went through. I could see at least two Hal
troopers, both with heavy weapons, in the bushes at the side of the track, and there were more around. I came
forward, made my way past Mimiannapandawawa, firing at the aggressors and telling her that she ought to
move back, that it was not safe for her to be there.... then proved my point, I suppose, as my screen over-
loaded and everything went black in a flare of pain.

I don't have a clear recollection of much else. I opened my eyes on the hilltop, everything blurred and spin-
ning, could hear the drop ship landing and many shouts about getting aboard fast, then being seized and half-
dragged, half-carried aboard. I was asking if Mimiannapandawawa was all right, could not make out what
was going on, who was where, couldn't even see the dropship. I was shaking, vision totally blurred, no
balance. We must have been half-way to the Garavaglia before I managed to get enough of a grip on reality
to find out what had happened.

Apparently, Turner had called for covering fire whilst he had gone in to collect me, then while he got me
back up the hill - by all accounts dragging me by the scruff of the neck! - the rest of the Marines had suc-
ceeded in obliterating the government forces. The drop ship had landed, just as Gina and
Mimiannapandawawa had given me cyclazine, then grabbed me and hauled me aboard - the pilot, quite
understandably, did not want to linger!

Back on the Garavaglia, we were given something to eat and an opportunity to rest.... or at least, some of us
were. Once we'd eaten, Mimiannapandawawa called Turner, Doe, Krinly and me together and made us sit the
Med-Tech 4 examination! Not very difficult, then we rejoined the others as we swapped tales and relaxed.
Someone had received a very interesting recording, apparently found amongst Waylander’s effects. Most of it
covered events well before my time in the Corps, although he mentioned the mission to Juliette last year, the
covert operation which is still causing great diplomatic turmoil.

Then Calvin arrived to hold a debrief. He said that we had achieved all our mission objectives, having
delivered the supplies to the rebels and obtained the data. Turner said that the data was already in the hands
of the Intel people, but they hadn't said anything yet. The two surviving training officers had been rescued,
although the videotape of them "confessing" was still in government hands. Without the actual people,
however, it's unlikely that they will be able to make much mileage out of it. Calvin said that he'd been im-
pressed with our performance, and that Schwartzkopf was to be promoted to Marine First Class forthwith.
He was also recommending that Martins be restored to the rank of Sergeant, and that Gina be considered for
promotion. Mimiannapandawawa announced that Turner, Doe, Krinly and I had all qualified as Med-Tech 4.

So, it seems that UWI have made yet another mess of things. It's pretty obvious that the rebel groups had
been seriously infiltrated by government forces, and that this mission - a use of force - had been as unsuc-
cessful in the overall aim of changing the Hal political economy as last year’s covert mission had been.
Despite the presence of UWI agents on planet, they still had little idea of what was going on, or ideas about
how to influence affairs. And of course, nobody has addressed the question of whether or not they ought to
be interfering in the first place. While few civilised people are prepared to accept slavery, is it really up to the
United Worlds what a non-aligned planet chooses to allow? Express an opinion, yes, but to intervene in the
way we have done? It's not up to us in the Corps to make such choices, but it does seem that there has been a
distinct lack of consideration of ethics at higher levels, as well as a lack of coherent thought or sensible
Strategy once the decision to interfere has been reached. Think I'm quite glad to be a "grunt"!

With all my respects,

Mexal
