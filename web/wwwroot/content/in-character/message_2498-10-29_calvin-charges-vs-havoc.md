# Disciplinary Charge : Absent without Leave

- Against             : Havoc, Corporal
- Brought by          : Calvin, A Captain
- Date                : 25/10/2501

## Details:

On the morning of 25/10/01, while the company was in preparation for a
combat patrol to intercept a hostile force believed to be holding Cpl
Casselle and Lt Oslo, Corporal Havoc left her assigned patrol group and
the base of operations without leave to do so.

No authorisation was given or sought for this action either from her
squad leader or from the commanding officer present at the time.

No other member of her squad had been advised of this action or had been
given orders by Havoc to mount a reconnaisence mission with her.

This action was planned and pre-meditated as Cpl Havoc had insisted on
getting early activation of her ICS from Tech Sgt Mexal.

Although Cpl Havoc later returned to the unit during the course of the
engagement, her action may well have compromised the operation if not
her own safety. This action also constitutes a serious breach of
standard operating procedure.

In debreifing Havoc, her given reason for the action appeared to be a
concern for Cpl Casselle. However during the engagement Cpl Casselle and
Lt Oslo were located by Lt Turner and Myself, no evidence of active
search was observed on the part of Cpl Havoc.

In making this charge I am aware that my own opinions of Havoc may
influnce any decision of my making I therefor request an independant
review of the charge by a senior officer. However in doing so I would
strongly urge that Havoc is relieved from active duty and any position
of responibility in the CMC.


Capt. A. Calvin
