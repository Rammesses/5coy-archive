##### Personal History:

Joel Turner is the only son of Martha and Frank Turner, kelp farmers on the water world
of Alpha Centauri. At an early age he showed an aptitude for machines and computers,
which was encouraged at the Atlantis College where he was sent for schooling at age 7.
This alienated him from his parents to the extent that in March 2488 at age 18 he left
planet, having hacked into the computers of and stowed away on a bunny-hopping
transport bound for Lumiere.

He was caught on-ship just 24 hours into the trip, but easily paid his passage with his
computer skills. On Lumiere, he met a group of mercenaries on the street when they
found him hooked in with a portable terminal attempting to extort money from the
Lumiere central bank. This group was the Sugar Mice mercenary group (see reference
EncGal-023452/834), who saw his potential and recruited him. He was trained in basic
combat techniques by them but specialised in electronic sabotage and similar skills.

After a mercenary operation turned sour in January 2490, Turner and two fellow Mice,
the Crisp brothers, joined a joint CMC / Mercenary operation on Altair 6, to suppress the
apparent uprising there. Both Crisp brothers were killed in that action, and Turner was
exposed and became adicted to Dextramol. He subsequently joined the CMC at Boot-
Camp in March 2490 with two other ex-Mice personnel, Jonathon Shade and William
(Wild Bill) Williams.

During his basic training he impressed his instructors, gaining Comms-Tech 2a, Basic
EOD Techniques and perhaps unsurprisingly Comp-Tech 1 qualifications. He was also
promoted to Corporal.

Turner has remained with 5-Coy CMC ever since, participating in major missions on
Altair 4, Serentia 2, Eta Ceptai and Formalhaut, as well as being promoted to Sargeant,
and briefly Sargeant-Major. In May 2492, he was detached from active duty with 5-Coy
to head up IRAG, a new CMC division tasked with providing specialist computing and
data retrieval facilities for Marine operations.

Turner rejoined 5-Coy on active duty in December 2494, and has participated in every
mission since, most often commanding a squad of Marines. Turner was not involved in
the Marie-Celesta boarding operation - at the time he was performing maintenance tasks
on IRAG relay equipment (something he is required to do with annoying regularity).

During a classified operation, his commanding officer was captured and Turner was
required to take command of the company to retrieve his Commanding Officer. During
this action, he sustained a shattered wrist and partially crushed larynx and was invalided
off-planet. For this operation, Turner was given a field promotion to Acting 2nd
Lieutenant, which was sustained throught the following operation in which he again was
required to command the company. This operation resulted in the death of ex-CMC
Colonel Nasco, the butcher of Altair 4, whom Turner had known and participated in the
capture of on Serentia 2. From his report, it is clear that Turner held a long-standing (and
well-founded) grudge against Nasco and was not unhappy at his death, although the
operation also resulted in the death of his closest and oldest friend in the corps, Sgt
Julian Martins.
