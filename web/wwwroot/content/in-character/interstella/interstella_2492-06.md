### Altair IV Revisited
_Filed by: Jonathon Faroth, Altair IV, June 2492_

On 28 July 2491, Altair IV was declared a plague planet and put into 
quarantine, just after the last of the CMC detachment based there 
had cleared the surface.

In the recent trial of Colonel Nasce (retd) it was suggested that 
the virus that caused this plague - a mutated form of Hansen's 
disease - was deliberately infliced on the planet by a consortium 
made up of high ranking CMC officers, big businesses and purists.

I have just returned from this sad, doomed planet, and the plague 
has wreaked a heavy toll indeed. A large, relatively new colony 
had been thriving on this temperate planet, together with a far 
larger number descended from the original colonists, who had 
been planted before the Colonial War.

Due to the isolation and the lack of understanding of 
Incapacitating Radiation (I/R) at that time, these first colonists 
and their decendants suffered from constant over-exposure to I/R. 
This has eventually resulted in toughened, green skin, that seems 
to protect them from some of the effects of IR (GMJ May 2492), 
but a much lower average IQ than human norm.

The Urthankoi, as they call themselves, or 'Grobs' as they are 
more unkindly - but commonly - called, have only suffered in the 
region of 75% fatalities from the plague, despite being its main 
target. Perhaps surprisingly, the unmutated new human stock appears 
to have suffered far more, with very few survivors.

However, the few humans I did manage to meet on the planet seemed 
to be more afraid of the Urthankoi than anything else. One Aldred 
Walf told me "The green skinned b*****ds have been hunting us down, 
they know all the places you can hide, they've been rounding us up, 
then killing us slowly. I lost all my family that way - they let me 
go after I was made to watch them kill them all... the only reason 
they let me go was so that they could have some more fun catching
me."

From what I was told, the persecution of unmutated humans has 
tailed off in recent months, but the survivors stay well out of 
the way of the Urthankoi. The tiny bands of humans that are left 
seem to be very widely spread, and according to the genetic 
specialist I have spoken with if there is no injection of new 
genes, the humans on Altair IV are doomed.

Contrary to the experts' predictions at the time of Krystal 
Spyres report, only 75% of the population of Altair IV has died, 
as oppsed to 99%, but the Urthankoi are now suffering from two 
major side-effects from the plague. Since the onslaught of Hansen's 
Disease, the mortality rate for new-born children is far higher 
than before, at least three times higher from what I could gather, 
and according to one Urthankoi who would talk to me about the
subject, the rate of pregnancy has plummeted.

Since the disease was caused by us "civilised" humans, it must be 
up to someone, someone responsible, to put this heinous wrong, right. 
However, the various official bodies deny all responsibility, and 
seem more intent on forgetting this sad and dying planet than on 
helping. Who can blame the Urthankoi for venting their pain and 
frustration on the only ones they can find? What would YOU do?...

### Judge Judas Killed

News just in reveals that the Judge responsible for clearing the 
former Colonel Nasco of the CMC of all charges - despite overwhelming 
evidence - was killed together with the rest of the passengers and 
crew when the Star Cruiser "Comet's Luck" exploded during take-off 
from Eta Ceptai. The cause of this tragedy is not yet known, but 
sabotage has not been ruled out.

### More Trouble For 5 Coy

As well as suffering from a faulty JSE Drive, 5 Coy are beset with 
yet more problems. Allegations of the use of certain highly illegal 
narcotic dugs have been made by an as yet anonymous source, although
it is not thought to be widespread.

Also the subject of many a rumour is the Coy's adjutant, whose health 
has come under increasing scrutiny. Apparently she was rushed to CMC 
Central HQ Med-Lab for 'unspecified' tests. This follows her 
imprisonment upon Sirius, when she was held hostage by an 
ursurper to the Barony.

It is understood that death threats have been received by one of 
5 Coy's med-techs and a member of its security squad, Cpl O'Shaunessy 
and Sgt Apone respectively. This follows their part in the highly 
publicised execution of Marine Warlock upon Sirius for offenses 
against the Projectile Weapons Acts. Both marines are currently under 
CMC protection.

News just in would seem to indicate that undercover CMC operatives 
have had some sucess in their hunt for the missing doctor Lt Sgn 
Diamond. Flight plans for the ship carrying her away from Altair IV 
have apparently been 'obtained' from a terrorist group.

### Groombridge Situation Worsens
_Filed by: Morgan Blake - Kasdun, on Groombridge, June 2492_

The worsening political situation in the Chidan region on Groombridge 
looks set to finally errupt into violence. Last month a UW Diplo 
Team was flown in to try to mediate between the two sides, and to 
prevent what so many have dreaded - conflict once more on Groombridge.

Tempers flared when the representative for the region of Chidan 
declared the province's independance at a meeting of the planet's 
Central House last month. The Groombridge authorities do not favour 
Chidanian separation, and have threatened military action if the 
Chidanians continue with their bid. Trouble escalated, however, when 
the neighbouring region of Kasdun threatened to pull out of the 
Central House if the Chidanians were sucessful. A squad of Colonial 
Marines were drafted in to keep the peace whilst the Diplo Team
negotiated for a non-agressive solution.

Originally, 5 Coy were posted to the area, but a fault with the JSE 
Drive on their drop-ship forced 4 Coy to the region instead. 
Unfortunately, agitators took advantage of the resulting delay to 
stir up antagonism between the opposing sides, and several minor 
outbreaks of violence occurred. 4 Coy eventually restored order, but 
the subsequent political ramifications have made the Diplo Team's 
task so much harder.

Although the initial reason for discontent in the area is political, 
religious influences are now also at work. The Future Party - which 
actively supports the ancient druidic type icons - has claimed that 
many of its members living in the region have been openly persecuted 
by the puritanistic Chidanians. The 'One True Church' - although 
totally separate from the Puritans - is said to also have been 
shocked by the upsurge of "primitive beliefs", but it has denied 
calling upon its followers to purge the world of the so-called
heretics. Nonetheless, fanatics on both sides are calling for a 
jihad - a holy war...

Tension in the area is said to be at its highest level since the 
'Groombridge Bush War' and it is doubtful whether the Diplo Team 
can salvage a peaceful solution before full-scale conflict ensues.

### News In Brief

United Worlds have rejected new legislation proposed by New Worlds 
(see Interstella - Jan 2492) involving a change to the laws governing 
the terra-forming of planets. New Worlds must continue to prove that 
the planet is free of any sentient life-sorms before it commences 
terra-forming.

New Worlds have been summoned to appear before the UW to explain 
allegations that they have destroyed thousands of alien artifacts.
