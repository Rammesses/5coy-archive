### Diplo Team Kidnap Shock!
_Filed by: Krystal Spyers - Chidan, on Groombridge, July 2492_

The United Worlds (UW) was reeling from the shock news that the 
Diplo Team assigned to the Chidanian region of Groombridge had 
disappeared under extremely suspicious circumstances. Responsibility 
had been claimed by several groups, including the Freedom for Chidan 
Movement (FCM) and the Offworlders Victimisation League (OVL), and a 
variety of ransom notes had been delivered to the UW.

The tentative cease-fire that the Diplo Team had negotiated prior to
their kidnapping was brutally shattered as all sides blamed each other
for this crime. The body of the Honoured Noble William Zaithin - the 
Chidanian representative in the Central House - was found in the Diplo
Team's quarters, as was the badly injured Kasdunni general, Limpz 
Schmidt. The General is now said to be in a satisfactory state, 
although he has not as yet regained consiousness. Representatives from
the Puritans, the Future Party and the 'One True Church' had not been
present when the attack came, although all expressed their shock and 
outrage.

Minor skirmishes between radicals escalated into major battles, as 
4 Coy - the lone company of Colonial Marines in the area at that 
time - tried desperately to restore some kind of order. Their own 
morale taking a severe beating, however, as it was realised that a 
CMC Officer, Captain Gillham of 5 Coy, whom had been seconded to the 
Diplo Team for the duration of the negotiations, was also missing.

The UW was not slow to react to the kidnapping however, and an elite 
CMC Special Forces squad - the "Black Flaggers" - from 3 Coy was 
secretly dispatched to the region as soon as the news was received. 
Volunteers from other CMC companies are understood to have been part 
of the back up force flown in at the same time.

From the brief details released by CMC Central Command, it would 
appear that the perpetrators - whose affiliations have not yet been 
revealed - had split the Diplo Team into small groups, hiding them 
across the Chidanian lowlands. Unfortunately, two members of the 
Diplo Team had been murdered by the time the marines reached the 
heavily forrested area, but three were rescued alive after what were 
described by CMC Command as "classic night maneuvers" and "good solid 
teamwork". Captain Gillham and the man who headed the Diplo Team - who 
has not yet been identified for security reasons - were later 
recovered after having escaped from their prison.

Although the personel involved have not been names, eyewitnesses 
praised the speed and efficiency of the legendary "Black Flaggers". No 
losses were reported amongst their number, although one marine did 
suffer a broken leg during the night rescue.

It is understood that several prisoners were taken during the 
mission.

It is almost impossible to ascertain any more details of the events 
of the past few days, as the region is in uproar, and fighting is still
continuing despite the safe return of the majority of the Diplo Team. 
Members of the Intergalactic Press Corps have been 'asked' to remain in
the shelters until the area is stabilised. Thousands of government 
soldiers have been posted to the region in an attempt to restore order,
but the chaos continues.

One strange and disturbing report that has reached our attention 
despite the confusion, concerns several cases of apparent human 
sacrifice - although the truth behind such claims has yet to be 
established. The Future Party denies any knowledge of such practices.

### Other Headlines

**A UW INQUIRY** has been launched following recent claims of vote
rigging in the elections on munro back in May. The Evolution Party
has put forward evidence which it says proves that the Liberal
Society did not gain victory the 'honest way'. A team of investigators
is thought to be on their way to the planet at this very moment.

**SABOTAGE** still has not been rules out in the case of the tragic loss
off the Star Cruiser "Comet's Luck" last month. Speculation as to
foul play has been fueled by rumours that Judge "Judas" - who was
aboard - was silenced before he could speak about his part in the
Nasco Trial. The investigating team yesterday refused to comment.

**MORE DEATHS ON SIRIUS** were reported earlier this month. following an
accident at a purification plant. Official sources have stated that
the cause of the trouble was corrosion due to the hostile conditions
onworld. Amongst the dead were several of Baron Lukel's retinue. The 
Baron was said to be saddened by the tragic loss.

### Aliens or Hoax

A survey team on an uninhabited frontier world has apparently reported
the discovery of several alien artifacts. Although the authenticity of
the claim has not been verified, the news has started the 
intergalactic grapevine buzzing. The UW has not named the planet in
question - for the obvious security reasons - but has stated that a
company of Colonial Marines will be sent into the region as a 
precautionary measure.

If the artifacts are indeed of sentient non-human origin, then what
are the chances that their makers are still onworld? We have
commissioned a treatise on the likelyhood of the existence of aliens
from a noted professor of Xeno-probability, which we will publish
shortly.

In the meantime, the galaxies await further developments with bated
breath.


### Groombridge Diplomacy

The UW have just named the Head of their Diplo Team on Groombridge as
the Lord High Keeper, Alemco Leopold Drahvet. The Lord High Keeper is
well renowned for his work in the Diplo field, but it is probably not
so widely known that he is the father of 5 Coy's missing doctor, Tane
Diamond.

Diamond, born Titania Sachan Drahvet, changed her name upon joining 
the CMC, in a bid to succeed on her own, and not just because she was
her "father's daughter".

The Lord High Keeper has a previous daughter Synna, by his first 
wife, who was killed in a bungled assassination bid in 2463.

Both girls joined 5 Coy in 2490.
