### Survey Team Feared Lost!
_Filed By: Morgan Blake, August 2492_

Fears were rising this week for the lives of the survey team who
recently filed a report with the United Worlds (UW) concerning the
discovery of alien artifacts upon a frontier world. Contact was
lost shortly before a company of Colonial Marines were due to be
posted to the as yet unnamed planet.

A UW spokesperson stated yesterday that the marines would still be
sent to the area. According to him, the survey team had previously 
reported the approach of an unusually large weather front, which may
actually have been resposible for blocking their signals. "The team
may be in no danger at all, they may just be sheltering out the
storm in their domes. All this furore about trouble and danger is just
scaremongering".

On the other hand - the grapevine says - perhaps the artifacts 
discovered by the team were not quite as abandoned as they'd thought.
"What would you do if you returned home from work to find someone
helping themselves to your valuables?" is a common question. It
should therefore come as no surprise to find out that tales of
hideously, painful alien tortures are circulating wildly, and have
progressed well beyond the reals of modern-day science-fiction.

The Hengists are unsurprisingly 'over a moon' about the possibility of
proof of alien life, and say that the scientists are probably even now
being shown the answers to some of the great mysteries of live and
creation. Whilst not entirely believable, it is a pleasanter thought
than that of bloodthirsty, armour-plated, five-legged killers!

So until reports are received from the marines being sent to the 
area, we can only wait and see...

### Baron Haze Arrested!

The UW team investigating the Intergalactic Swindle yesterday placed
Baron Haze of Tremus Dex (the planet officially known as Rhalanor)
under arrest for his part in the affair.

At first it was believed that the Baron had lost his entire fortune
after having been duped by a close friend, but now it is alledged
that he wsa a knowing accomplice, and played an important role by
encouraging his peers to invest with the fraudsters.

If found guilty, Baron Haze can expect life-long imprisonment, and
the removal of his title and all estates.

The Baroness is understood to be shocked by the whole business, and
is receiving med-treatment.

The Baron's trial is due to begin at the end of September.

### It's War...
_Filed by: Krystal Spyers - Chidan, on Groombridge, August 2492_

For those who have not heard, full-scale war has been declared in 
the Chidanian and Kasdunni regions on Groombridge. Trouble flared 
back in May when Chidan declared its independance before the planet's 
Central House, and several minor skirmishes sprang up between 
Chidanian seperatists and Kasdunni agitators. However, following the
kidnap of the UW Diplo Team and the murder of two of its members in
July, these minor battles erupted into full-scale conflict.

Both sides vehemently deny any involvement in the kidnap plot, and
both are as equally adamant that the other side was responsible. 
Many small organisations have tried to claim responsibility, but it
is suspected that these claims are all false.

Half of the Groombridge military has been dispatched to the region,
but instead of separating the sides they have found themselves 
attacked by both. This bizarre three-way battle is further 
complicated by the attempts of agitators to create a jihad, a holy war
between the Future Party, the Puritans and the 'One True Church'. The
Future Party supports the worship of druidic type icons, as used to be
worshiped back in the 'Dark Days' on Sol. They have been accused by 
both the Puritans and the OTC of human sacrifice, and of pagan 
ceremonies with amoral undertones. This is denied by the FP 
spokesperson as "vicious trouble making by those who wish to turn 
public support away from us".

The Kasdunni general, Limpz Schmidt, has finally regained consiousness 
following injuries sustained during the kidnap of the Diplo Team, but
is unable to throw light upon the identity of the cuprits. The 
Honoured Noble William Ziathin, who was killed during the same attack,
was cremated last week, as per his last will and testament.

Unlike the Groombridge Bush War, the weaponry used in the trouble zone
is all clean - i.e. using Incapacitating Radiation (I/R) instead of
projectiles, high-ex, N, B & C. This means that the damage caused is
only to the combatants, and not to the environment or equipment. If
those equipped with military screens are injured by and are treated
within a given time, they will recover, however those who are using
cheaper versions of screens will not be so adequately protected.
Needless to say, military screens only give an advantage for as long
as the necessary drugs needed to treat I/R are available...

Some refugees are already flooding from the region where they can,
but most are staying in their domes, hoping that a peaceful solution
can be negotiated before the hardships brought on by war are felt.

The Lord High Keeper, Alemco Leopold Drahvet has insisted on 
returning to his post as head of the Diplo Team, despite his kidnap.
He is understood to have communicated his thanks to the 'Black Flaggers'
for their part in the rescue of three of the members of his Team, and
has publicly expressed his sorrow and regret to the families of those
who were murdered before the CMC Special Forces arrived. The Diplo Team
is still trying to arrange a meeting between the Chidanians, the
Kasdunni and the Head of the Groombridge military, to discuss the 
possibility of a cease-fire and negotiationf for a peaceful solution.

**KELP BLIGHT** has devastated the harvests on Alpha Centauri. Official

of 2 Coy is charged with malpractice, and membership of the outlawed

**5 COY'S CAPTAIN** Gillham returned to duty last week, following his
