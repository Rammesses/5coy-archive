##### Prepared by Sgt Turner (TJ121710)

### 1: Introduction

This document forms the course notes for the CMC Radio Operator Level 2 course
(course no. CMC96/1T0102/B), and as such is required reading for that course.

Evaluation of this course is by a supervised practical examination of the subjects studied,
supported by a written examination.

##### 1.1: Course Prerequisites

Any marine taking this course must have already successfully completed Radio Operator
Level 4. These notes are intended for those taking the Radio Operator Level 2 cours, and
should be read in conjunction with those for Radio-Ops 4 (course no. CMC96/1T0101/B).

### 2: Course Description

Radio Operator Level 2 qualification is the minimum qualification required for a Marine to
use radio equipment during an operation acting as Squad Radio Operator. As such, it
provides a solid basis in the protocols required for efficient radio communications in a
tactical situation.

### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: What is a Squad Radio Operator?

A marine is described as a Squad Radio Operator when he or she is designated by the
squad Leader to act as the primary communications link for the Squad.

###### 4.1.1: Responsibilities of a Squad Radio Operator

The radio operator is required to operate the equipment and pass messages clearly as
required by the tactical situation and/or orders from a superior officer. This requires a
more in-depth knowledge of radio communications protocols so that radio comms may
be used efficiently.

###### 4.1.2: Training and Advancement

The Radio Operator Level 2 training course is designed to ensure that all marines acting
as Squad Radio Operator do so efficiently.

Further training and advancement in communications techniques is provided by the more
specialist CommsTech qualifications, and then further by the Tactical Operations
qualifications .

###### 4.1.3: Course Structure

The RadioOps-2 course is presented as an informal lecture covering the syllabus,
followed by a practical session using live comms equipment to allow trainees to gain
confidence in the required protocols.

For final qualification, trainees are required to take and pass a written examination, and a
supervised practical examination using live equipment.

### 4.2: Introduction to Radio Communications

Radio communications have been used for over 600 years of human history. First
succesfully demonstrated by Marconi in 1901, the technology has been cruical to the
developent of mankind over the last half-milenia.

With the advent of sub-space communications, this technology too has been dubbed
‘radio , dispite the misnomer.

###### 4.2.1: Radio Communications Equipment

The range of radio communications equipment used by the CMC is subdivided into
classes. These classes are defined by the frequency band used by the equipment (see
4.2.3 below), and the transmitted power rating of the equipment.

- Classes A, B & C (normally refered to as Comms-A, Comms-B and Comms-C) 
are those normally used by Radio Operators during a mission, with
ranges of approximately 2km, 5km and 10km (maximum) respectively.

- Class 4 is designated for short range planetary communications, with a
maximum range of 200Km

- Class 3 is designated for planetary communications, with a maximum range
of 10000Km, and relies on atmospheric effects for coverage.

- Class 2 is designated for tight-beam orbital and inter-systemic com-
munications, with a maximum range of 100,000,000Km or more. Being
tight beam, increased alignment accuracy is required for longer ranges.

- Class 1 is designated for sub-space communications. The maximum range of
this class of communications has not yet been determined.

###### 4.2.3: Frequency Allocations and Channels

The CMC uses equipment on a number of frequencies. The exact frequencies used by
any given channel is the subject of discussion in the Comms Tech 4 course. The general
frequency allocations are:

+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Usage                    | Frequency   | Designation    |
+==========================+=============+================+
| Inter/Intra-Squad        | 49Mhz       | Comms C, B & A | 
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Short-Range Planetary    | 20-200Mhz   | Comms 4        |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Planetary Communications | 100-500kHz  | Comms-3        |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Orbital Communications   | 20Ghz       | Comms-2        |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Sub-Space Communications | 200 VirtMHz | Comms-1        |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+

##### 4.3: Call-signs & Personal Codes

Names and nicknames are should never be used in radio communications. Although this
rule may very occasionally be overlooked in the heat of combat communications, the use
of call-signs is vital for intra-squad and other tactical communications.

###### 4.3.1: CMC Tactical Call-signs

During tactical operations, single character codes are used as call-signs for the major
tactical units.

* Alpha...Golf -  Operational groups (squads) 1-7
* Hotel - Support Unit (often a Mothership)
* India...Lima - Dropships 1-4
* Tango - Command Group
* X-Ray - Fire Support Units (Armour, Air-cover, etc)
* Zulu - Covert units.

The call-signs for the operational groups, and which support groups are available will be
determined during the operational briefing. In use, messages for a particular group are
handled by the radio operator attached to (or nearest to ) the group commander, and are
for his or her attention. Alternatively, the commander may handle his or her own com-
munications. The following example illustrates the use of codes, and uses the protocols
described later.

_"Bravo, this is Tango. Bravo, this is Tango. RV with Charlie at grid ref 146435. Repeat, RV
with Charlie at grid ref 146435. Confirm. Over."_

_"Tango, this is Bravo. Tango this is Bravo. Confirm RV with Charlie at grid ref 146435. Out."_

Sub-units within operation groups (such as fire-teams) are designated with sub-codes.
Messages using sub-codes are given for the attention of the commander of the sub-unit.
The example below uses Combat Communications protocol, which is described later in
this text.

_"Bravo-2 from Bravo-7."_

_"Bravo-2 receiving. Over."_

_"Bravo-2 from Bravo-1. Sweep trees 3 o'clock, 400 metres, then hold at far side. Over."_

_"Bravo-1 from Bravo-2. Moving. Out."_

In the above, Bravo-1 is the first (or commander's) squad and Bravo-2 is the second (or
support) squad. If several tactical groups are operating in close proximity, com-
munications between sub-units is often necessary. For example, consider Bravo and
Charlie units trying to regroup in fog after a heated combat.

_"Bravo-2 from Charlie-1."_

_"Bravo-2 receiving. Over."_

_"Bravo-2 from Charlie-1. Flash one to confirm position. Over."_

_"Charlie-1 from Bravo-2. Standby for flash one. Over."_

Bravo-2 indicates his position with a torch flash or similar. Note that this is not neces-
sarily a good idea in the middle of combat!

_"Bravo-2 from Charlie-1. Seen. We are 100 metres at your 2 o’clock. Repeat, 100 metres
at 2 o'clock your position. Out."_

##### 4.3.2: Personal Call-signs

When a Marine first qualifies as a Radio Operator or Comms Tech, he or she may choose
a personal call-sign. This call-sign is generally only used in extreme cases when a Marine
is separated completely from any tactical groups, or if he or she is required for specific
duties because of specialist training. The personal call-sign has the format
`alpha num num`, for example, `Oscar 8 6`

As an example of the use of personal call-signs, consider the situation where commander
of one tactical unit might call specifically for his or her highest qualified Comp Tech to
examine some equipment. The call might be as follows.

_"Bravo from Alpha. Bravo from Alpha. Hold position. Repeat, hold position. Confirm. Over."_

_"Alpha from Bravo. Alpha from Bravo. Understood. Out."_

_"Sierra Zero Eight from Alpha-1. Sierra Zero Eight from Alpha-1. Move up on my position -
we've found some equipment. Over."_

_"Alpha-1 from Sierra Zero Eight. On my way, LT. Out."_

##### 4.4: Radio Communications Protocols

When using radio communications, a set of protocols are used When adhered to, these
structure the transmission of messages and conversations to ensure clear and efficient
passing of messages.

###### 4.4.1: Situation Reports and Tactical Operation Codes

In a tactical situation, the clear communication of situation reports is vital so that the CO
can manage the operation. The key to this communication in the Situation Report (or
SitRep) and the use of Tactical Operation Codes.

###### 4.4.2: Situation Reports

The SitRep is used as stuctured method of reporting the status of a tactical group upon
request by the CO. It is generally used to provide tactical information to higher command
levels than the squad, often being passed right up the chain of command, and is par-
ticularly used during Battalion level operations. Note the Pro-Words given beside each
entry - these are used to separate each part of the SitRep during transmission.

The SitRep format is as follows:

Originator ID or Code Org
Authentication Code Auth
Date Date

Transmission Start Time (Zulu) start
Mission Time Mike
Location or Location Code Loc
Status Description or Code stat

Contacts (total) Foxtrot
Hostile Contacts X-Ray
Non-Combatant Contacts Yankee
Unknown Contacts Zulu
Position(s) of Contacts Tango

Unit Casualty Status, comprising:

- Number of Fully Operational Marines Alpha
- Number of Injured, but Operational Marines Bravo
- Number of Injured and Non-Operational Marines Charlie
- Number of Fatalities Delta

Any Other Information
Transmission End Time (zulu) End

Note, that the SitRep is a formal procedure, and must be reported exactly as described
above if it is to be of use to the chain of command. A queue-card or SitRep form may be
provided to assist in the compilation of the required data. An example SitRep transmis-
sion might be as follows:

_"Alpha from Tango, Alpha from Tango, Send SitRep, Repeat, Send SitRep."_

_"Tango from Alpha, Tango from Alpha, Standby."_

_"Tango from Alpha, SitRep reads: Org Alpha-1, Auth Bravo Tango 3 4, Date 230494, Start
1432, Mike 0023, Loc Point Bravo-4, Stat Code Metropolis, Foxtrot 4, X-Ray Zero,
Yankee Zero, Zulu 4, Tango 300 at 035. Alpha 8, Bravo Zero, Charlie Zero, Delta Zero,
End 1433. Confirm, Over."_

_"Alpha from Tango, Alpha from Tango, Received Clear, Out."_

###### 4.4.3: Tactical Operation Codes

Tactical Operation Codes (or TOCs) are used to provide status messages - usually at
important points of the operation - in a compressed form. They are sometimes used as
part of a SitRep (above), but more often on their own as a fast way of passing status
messages. TOCs are always prefixed by the word ‘Code’ in a transmission. Listed below
are some of the standard TOCs.

- Code Whiskey - Additional support required immediately.
- Code X-Ray - Emergency evacuation of tactical group required immediately
(usually accompanied by the initiation of an EBU or ESU beacon signal).
- Code Yankee - Insertion of tactical group completed successfully.
- Code Zulu - Extraction of tactical group requested.
- Code Woodland - No threat forces encountered in immediate area.
- Code Metropolis - Threat forces suspected in immediate area.
- Code Graveyard - Threat forces in control of immediate area.

In use, TOCs may be grouped together. A typical set of transmissions might be as
follows.

_"Tango this is Alpha, Tango this is Alpha. Declaring Code Yankee Woodland. Declaring
Code Yankee Woodland. Over."_

_"Alpha from Tango. Alpha from Tango. Received Code Yankee Woodland. Received Code
Yankee Woodland. Out"_

Note the use of repetition in the protocol. For SitReps and TOCs this is required to ensure
that the target of the message hears and understands. Notice the terseness of the trans-
missions - the aim of using TOCs. The response by the Command Group (Tango) may be
shortened still further - the shortest possible response would be as follows.

_"Alpha from Tango. Received. Out."_

A full list of TOCs is not presented here for space reasons, and as some are classified for
Officer Eyes Only, or are mission specific. In general, the tactical group’s OC will order a
radio operator to contact another group or the Command Group and declare a specific
status.

##### 4.5: Combat Communications

In combat situations, there is often no time to send the repeats required by the normal
communications protocols. In this situation, it is acceptable to use the following more
compact protocols.

The call-setup is used but once, and acknowledged quickly and simply.

_"Alpha-2 from Alpha-1. Receiving? Over."_

_"Alpha-2 receiving. Over."_

Similarly, all messages are shortened. If time is of the essence, the call-setup is dis-
carded and quick-fire messages are used. Note that when using Combat
Communications protocols, acknowledgement of a signal or message is mandatory.
Otherwise, control of the situation can be quickly lost.

_"Alpha-2 from Alpha-1. Move up 200 metres on line of march. Over."_

_"Alpha-1 from Alpha-2. Moving. Out."_

These protocols should only be used in combat. If at all possible, the standard com-
munications protocols should be used for greatest clarity and integrity of message. IF
combat protocols are being used, then special care must be taken to check for other
traffic and positively key the PTT well before speaking to ensure an open chanel, as this
protocol does not repeat information to cover interfering traffic and bad PTT action.

##### 4.6: Practical Session

The practical aspects of the course include practice in the use of all the above com-
munications protocols using role-play. Specific example scripts will be provided separate
to this document, covering:

- Status Messages
- Emergency Messages
- Use of Situation Codes
- Personal Messages
- Combat Communications

Once familiarity with the protocols has been gained by the student, a free-form, un-
scripted session will be held to consolidate the skills.

### 5: Review

A Squad Radio Operator

- uses Radio Comms Equipment
- is responsible for passing messages
- must be skilled in and adhere to using the appropriate protocols
- must know and use the phonetic alphabet

### 6: Assesed Written Test and Practical Session

Following the instructional sessions, the prospective Radio Operator is required to take
and pass both a written test and an assessed practical session before he or she is
granted the Radio Operator qualification.
