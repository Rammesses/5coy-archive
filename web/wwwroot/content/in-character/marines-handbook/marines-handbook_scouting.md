### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: What does a Scout do?

The job of a scout is really twofold, each of which is as important as the other, and each
requiring skills that many Marines do. not have. To fulfill your role properly you must
master the skills taught to you on this course, and practice them continuously.

The first role you have as a Marine Scout is to recce an area and bring back a clear and
concise report of what you have observed and very importantly, without having been
seen by any enemy in the area. The sort of information to look for will be covered.

The second role you have as a scout, is once you have returned from a recce and your
CO decides to send marines in, your role is to lead the marines in or clearly brief them,
as you should know what’s there, and the dangerous areas and either enable the
marines to avoid the danger or allow the marines to be particularly careful at danger
spots.

As a scout there is one attribute that you will find necessary to do the job properly and
survive above ail others and that is patience.

##### 4.2: Map and Compass

You are referred to the CMC Patrolling course notes. Course No.CMC96/1C0102/B

##### 4.3: Radios

You are referred to the CMC Radio Operators Courses, Course No.s CMC96/1T0101/B
and CMC96/1T0102/B.

##### 4.4: Camouflage

###### 4.4.1: Introduction

To be able to move into enemy territory it is important that you are well camouflaged and
maintain the camouflage at ail times, changing it where the surroundings change.

The human eye when looking, is very lazy and sees things it is expecting, so if you
appear to look like a bush in bush-land, the eye will only see a bush, if you do nothing to
draw attention to your self you will not be seen. Below are the simple rules you will need
to follow to maintain your camouflage.

###### 4.4.2: Shape

Alter your shape, especially your head, shoulder and weapon as these are very
recognisable human shapes.Use natural foliage and scrim net. Be careful you do
not use to much as this can impede your movement and can be counterproductive
and make you standout.

###### 4.4.3: Shade

Make sure your clothing and exposed skin are the same sort of colors as your Surroun-
dings. If possible change clothing if the surroundings are likely to change dramatically, ie.
a high chance of snow.

###### 4.4.4: Shadow

When moving or stationary try to stay in the shadow as this makes you harder to see, if
you cannot avoid casting a shadow be aware of where your shadow is casting.

###### 4.4.5: Silhouette

Your silhouette will show up when your dark shape is showing against a light background.
Avoid skylining yourself, tops of hills, through windows and doors, or looking or moving
past obstacies.

###### 4.4.6: Shine

Shiny surfaces catch an observers eye and will make them look more ciosely so dull
down any surfaces that are likely to shine,buckles, binos, sweat. At night using any light
will be seen at a great distance but especially white light therefore avoid using white light
at night.

###### 4.4.7: Surface

When camouflaged remember that your texture must match the surroundings or your
camoufiage will in fact give you away. Eg:Foliage in a building, or using a different foliage
aS a camouflage to those in the surroundings.

###### 4.4.8: Spacing

Avoid rapid and regular movement, keep your spacing irregular and not too close

###### 4.4.9: Silence

Avoid unnecessary talking, clatter, rattle,and bad whispering.Check you will be quiet
when moving before leaving base by jumping up and down, any rattles etc. should be
dealt with before leaving.

###### 4.4.10: Face Paint

When applying face paint it should not be just smeared on but put on carefully to do an
effective job.

Most camm-creams come in two tones, dark and light. Paint the light areas of the face
with the darker tone, such as the forehead, cheek-bones, nose and chin and the areas
normally in shadow in the lighter tone, for example under eyes, nose and chin.

Do not paint a regular pattern and do not follow the lines of the face. The hands back and
palm should also be painted.

Areas that often get missed are the ears, neck and eyelids.

lf camm-cream is unavailable burnt cork or mud can be used. If these are used they will
have to be renewed more often than the camm-creams.

When applying camm-cream it is best to work with your buddy to ensure that it is going
on correctly.

###### 4.4.11: Putting it all Together

Stay low whenever possible, this makes you look less human(shape) and when at rest
tuck yourself against a tree or obstacle (shape,shadow, silhouette).

When moving take advantage of all available cover and concealment.

##### 4.5:Observation

###### 4.5.1: Map Making

When making maps on a mission keep the writing legible and include as many
measurements and bearings as possibile. Practice is the key to drawing good sketch
While an accurate scale is not possible try to keep the map you are drawing should be
have some relation to each other

Avoid putting any information on the map about friendly units placements or future plans
in case of capture.

###### 4.5.2: Four Leaf Clover

Once you have reached the objective the four leafed clover technique should be used.
Firstly final briefings and checks should be made and excess kit dropped off at the
Objective Rallying Point (ORP) and one man left to guard this point.

The other three move off to a point that is off line to the ORP and about 20 -30m from the
enemy position. This security point is manned by one man with the patrols heaviest
weapon.

This man should make a sketch map of the area.

The other two men move of in the four leaf pattern,getting as close as possible, with one

man stopping about 5m short of the enemy position. As they go round they should make
as detailed sketch maps and notes as possible.

###### 4.5.3: What to Look For

When observing the enemy there are a number of things to look for. A good acronym for
this is SALUTE.

* S...S1Ze,
* A...Activity
* L...Location
* U...Unit
* T... Time
* E...Equipment

The list below expands this some what and gives more detail of what you are after.

Analysing:-

**Ground in general**, to inciude:-

Differences from maps, routes in and out, covered approaches,escape routes, obstacles,
blind spots, positions for own HQ,ERV’s, heavy weapons.

**Enemy troops** to include:-

Weapon strength, uniforms, morale, numbers, crack elements,support weapons, static
positions, flares, APD’s, minefield,guard positions with beats and timings, HQ position,
medical facilities, radio.

**Enemy intentions** to include:-

Resting places, Re-organization areas, observation areas,muster points for large scale
attacks.

###### 4.5.4: Use of Binoculars and Telescopes

Binoculars and telescopes in the hands of an experienced Scout will make his job much
easier to do and more successful than a scout without the instruments. However much
practice is needed to be a good “Glassman”.

When handling binoculars or telescopes remember they are precision instruments and if
the best results are to be obtained from them they must be treated with care.

lf they get dirty do not clean the glass with any sort of cloth or your hands, use a clean
piece of soft, grit free cloth. If they get wet dry them out slowly in a warm room, not in
front of a neater.

When using either instrument remember the sun catching the glass will give your position
away very quickly, so use a sun shade to avoid this happening.

Always use a rest if possible when searching, especially with telescopes.

When searching an area break it up into sectors and check each sector slowly, ensuring
that the sectors overlap.

Slight movement is more easily detected if you are not looking directly at the movement.
Always look a little to the sides and up and down, especially when light conditions are
bad.

When you have seen a suspicious looking object do not move until you have ascertained
what it is and why it is there.

##### 4.6: Setting Observation Points

When selecting your OP site there are eight rules to remember.

1. You must be able to see all the ground given in your orders.

2. Your field of view must be as great as possible with as little dead ground
as possible.

3. You must have a covered approach and exit.
4. The position must offer protection from view and fire.
5. You are able to contact HQ by radio.

6. You have alternative sites in case the selected site is un-usable for any
reason.

7. It is not too obvious a site.

8. The longer you intend to remain at the OP the more comfortable and
weather resistant it must b.

### 5: Review

A marine qualified in Scouting should be able prepare for and then move around the
battlefield as ordered without being seen,observing the enemy and report on anything
seen.

### 6: Assessed Written and Practical Examination:

Following instructional session(s) you are required to take a written examination and
practical examination before being granted the Scout qualification.
