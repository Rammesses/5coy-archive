Course CMC95/1W0109 - EOD Specialist - Level 4.

Document No. 141/003/A

##### Prepared by Tech-Sgt Mexal

### 1: Introduction

This document forms the course notes for the CMC Explosives/Ordnance Disposal Level
4 course (Course no. CMC95-1W0109), and as such is required reading for that course.

Evaluation of this course is by a supervised practical examination (using dummy
devices), supported by a written examination.

### 2: Course Description

This course is designed to provide an introduction to the safe disposal of explosive
devices, but it must be recognised that as many such devices are improvised, no course
can teach about
every bomb or booby-trap that may be encountered, and the specialist must be ready to
continue his education - by both formal study and by information exchange with other
specialists - throughout his career.

The Level 4 course deals with search and containment procedures, the action to be taken
on finding a suspect device, and some of the hazards likely to be encountered. Further
courses may be undertaken to enable you to assist and eventually become an EOD
Operator yourself.

### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: What is EOD?

Explosive/Ordnance Disposal covers the detection and making safe of any explosive
device encountered. This includes searching suspect areas, individuals or items; and
declaring the ‘All Clear’ when satisfied that there is no threat to Marines or other person-
nel.

An EOD specialist is also expected to advise mission commanders as to the likelihood of
the need for a full-scale search of any given area, and to take responsibility for ordering
one whenever he feels that it is necessary. The ranking EOD specialist must take charge
of the situation and all other Marines (irrespective of rank) are expected to obey instruc-
tions until the ‘All Clear’ is declared.

##### 4.2: Search techniques

Whenever tasked with a search, ensure that the area in which you are working is
protected from outside threat. Guards should be posted at a distance such that they are
unlikely to be harmed by any device triggered within the search area, but close enough to
provide support. Make sure that your personal screen is active at all times.

Do not allow yourself to be rushed by circumstance or commanders. If you are unable to
complete a search to your satisfaction, it is your responsibility to define the area as un-
safe until there is opportunity for it to be cleared properly.

Your prime consideration must be your own safety. Enemy forces may deliberately target
search personnel. Your task is to identify any item which may be a threat, and to make
the appropriate arrangements for it to be dealt with by those competent to do so.

###### 4.2.1: Buildings

In searching a building, consider the time that the aggressor may have had available to
set devices, what equipment he is likely to have had, the state of the building (furnished,
derelict, good or bad repair etc.) and the need for it to be cleared for use by friendly
forces.

Look for the unusual and the out-of-place. A fresh patch of plaster on an otherwise
shabby wall may conceal a charge. A mat or sheet of cardboard on a bare floor may
conceal a pressure pad. Beware obvious temptations - for example “evidence” of occupa-
tion or activities within the premises may be left for you deliberately, and either the
evidence itself or the surrounding area booby-trapped.

Think about how you would set booby-traps and where. Then look in those places. Watch
for trip wires and sensors in doorways and other openings. If a room is dark, consider the
possibility of encountering a light-sensitive device before you shine a torch or open the
curtains.

Do not allow yourself to be rushed. If you encounter one device, do not assume that it is
the only one, and do not assume that any other devices found will be similar.

###### 4.2.2: Bodies (alive or otherwise)

There are various situations in which you may have to search a body. To begin with, it
may be a corpse or a living person, who may be unconscious or awake. Live people may
be injured or otherwise incapacitated. The individual may be an enemy, unknown or even
a Marine. These factors will all affect the way in which you conduct your search.

A dead or unconscious body should be approached with caution. Body searches should
be conducted by two people working together - this does not include those assigned to
guard the search team whilst they work.

First make a visual check from a distance. Look for anything unusual - wires, flashing
lights, sounds, odd items on or near the body etc. - before approaching closer. One
member of the search team should then take up a position where he has an uninter-
rupted and clear view of the body. He should be prepared to move as necessary to main-
tain his view as the other searcher performs a closer examination. His weapon should be
ready for use, should the “body” prove to be alive and aggressive once approached.

lf the visual check reveals nothing untoward, a closer inspection should be carried out. At
this stage, determine whether the body is alive. If so, a medic should stand by until the
search is complete in case medical attention is required. A pat-down search should be
carried out, without moving the body.

The final stage of the search involves turning the body over, to check that there is nothing
concealed underneath. Use the body itself to shield the searcher from any possible
explosion. The second searcher should position himself on the far side of the body, far
enough away that he is not endangered. Get low, and turn the body so that he can see if
there is anything there - he should shout “Clear” if nothing is there. Even if the subject of
the search is alive and injured, this procedure must be carried out, despite normal medi-
cal advice not to move casualties - failure to do so may endanger the lives of the medics
giving treatment later.

Once the body is declared clear, medical treatment may be initiated, or a more thorough
search for ID and other information be carried out.

A similar procedure may be followed with individuals who are conscious but incapable of
movement. Even if the person tells you that there is nothing to be found, do not take their
word for it, but perform a thorough search. This applies even if you are, for example,
required to search a fellow Marine who is found injured - he may not be aware of what a
enemy has done. Do not allow yourself to be goaded into rushing your search by pleas
for release or medical attention.

You may also be required to search a prisoner, although this is usually tasked to security
personnel. Again, use visual inspection followed by a pat-down search. Treat any items
removed with care until you are satisfied that they pose no threat.

###### 4.2.3: Items (e.g. boxes, pieces of kit and so on).

Whenever possible, suspect items should be marked, isolated and left for close inspec-
tion and disposal (if necessary) by someone competent to undertake these tasks.

Begin with a visual inspection of the item. Look for protruding wires or sensors, blinking
lights or anything else unusual.

Listen for any noise that it may be making. Check to see if there is anything underneath -
@.g. a pressure-release device.

lf possible, move the item remotely rather than by picking it up. A long pole or a hook and
line may be used.

lf the item is a box or other container, once you have satisfied yourself that it may be
moved safely, it may be necessary to open it. Always open a suspect container away
from you (and make sure that all other personnel are out of the way), for example, open a
briefcase from the rear so that the lid is between you and the contents.

lf you are in any doubt at all, LEAVE IT ALONE!

##### 4.3: Actions on finding a suspect device.

lf you believe that you have found any item which may be an explosive device you must
inform the mission commander or senior individual present (e.g. your squad commander)

immediately. Do not use a radio in the vicinity of the suspect item. Even if it is not radio-
triggered, a radio signal may cause parasitic currents in its circuitry and set it off.

Do not take chances - if you have any doubts about something that you have found, treat
it as suspect until told otherwise by somebody competent to do so.

Once a device is declared suspect, the following procedures should be carried out.

###### 4.3.1: Confirm

Check that there is a threat i.e. that it may well be a bomb; and that you know what it
looks like and exactly where it is.

You will have to brief the EOD Specialist who is called in to defuse it - his life may depend
on the accuracy of your observation and description.

###### 4.3.2: Clear

Move all personnel in the vicinity of the device to a safe area. Arrangements should be
made for the evacuation of any wounded, and for the containment of any prisoners or
suspect individuals.

###### 4.3.3: Cordon

When the area is clear, cordon troops must guard the area to ensure that no-one enters
the danger area. Use white mine tape or other suitable material, all barriers and potential
entry points should be manned.

###### 4.3.4: Control

The ranking Marine present should control all movement in the area, and set up an inci-
dent control point well outside the danger area to co-ordinate further action. Be careful
where you site your incident control point: if it is an obvious choice, you could sit on a
command detonated device or otherwise be at risk from enemy action.

##### 4.4: Equipment Available for Search

Some tools may be made available to you to assist in the conduct of a search, others you
may be able to improvise for yourself. Always be ready to make use of what you already
have or may find in the vicinity.

Useful items for searching within buildings include jemmies, spades, and screwdrivers. A
metal detector and explosives “sniffer” may also be available. Other items that can be
useful include torches (or a cold light source, which is less likely to trigger a light-sensitive
anti-handling device), inspection mirrors and a long pole for probing ahead and to shift
debris and other objects without the need to get too close.

However, as a member of a search team, you will probably have your greatest successes
by using your eyes and your common sense. Examine the area closely, and consider
how you would set about hiding items or setting booby-traps in that area.

Determine the most likely routes that someone entering the area would use, and check
them thoroughly - any hostile laying traps will be hoping that somebody will make an
incautious entry. Look for anything that is out-of-place, or seems strange.

Make sure that more than one person examines each area, another individual may see
something that you missed, and vice versa.

lf anything makes you suspicious, do not touch it, inform the search team commander
and all others present and prepare to carry out the actions upon finding a suspect device.

##### 4.5: Types of device in common use

In order to search effectively, it is essential to be aware of the range of devices that may
be encountered. Explosive devices vary according to the nature of the target, the skill of
the bomber and the time and materials that he has available when constructing and
placing the device.

They may incorporate commercial or home-made explosives (or both), and be initiated by
command detonation or a timing device, or be set off by the target. Furthermore, they
may be protected by anti-handling devices, placed solely to prevent the device being
removed or defused before it explodes. The main device may also be surrounded by
secondary devices, either set off by the main one or designed to damage searchers or
delay search and disposal operations.

###### 4.5.1: Command Detonation

Command detonated devices may be set off by command wire or by a radio signal. Either
of these requires the presence of a member of the hostile forces to issue the detonation
signal.

A command wire detonated device requires the individual initiating the bomb to be at the
end of a wire where he can see the target. If the device is discovered, it may be possible
to either trace the wire or analyse the surrounding area to spot a likely vantage point.
Whilst the individual is likely to be able to make good his escape, the device will be dis-
covered intact and may not have anti-handling devices protecting it. Do not rely on this;
you should still cordon the area and call for assistance to dispose of the device.

A radio detonated device requires more sophisticated equipment, and is also less con-
trolled than the command wire detonated device. Stray radio signals may trigger the
device prematurely; so whilst it is recommended that radios not be used in the vicinity of
suspect devices, a broadcast on a wide range of frequencies may be used to deliberately
detonate radio controlled bombs in an area which has been cleared of all personnel. The
individual intending to detonate the bomb may be at a considerable distance, and may
not have the location under direct observation, although he may be in communication
with somebody nearer the site.

###### 4.5.2: Timer Detonation

A timer detonated device is commonly used by a bomber who wishes to place a bomb
and be elsewhere before it explodes. Such a device may be planted days or weeks
before the planned detonation, and it is very likely to be protected by anti-handling
measures. Extreme caution should be exercised if you suspect that you have discovered
a timer detonated device.

###### 4.5.3: Target-triggered Detonation

The third main means of setting off a bomb is by “target influence’, whereby the presence
of the target initiates a trembler or other device. This detonation method may be the
primary means of initiating the bomb, or it may provide an anti-handling mechanism to
protect the device against attempts at removal or defusing.

Although the search procedures outlined above may find devices employing any of these
modes of initiation, those triggered by target influence pose the greatest threat to the
searcher; yet offer the best chance for successful disposal should they be discovered
without triggering them.

##### 4.6: Anti-handling Devices

The main anti-handling devices you are likely to encounter are trip wires, motion detec-
tors, pressure pads and light sensors.

All of these are designed to detonate the bomb when it is approached or interfered with.

###### 4.6.1: Trip Wires

Trip wires and other such devices are used to trap an individual moving in the vicinity of
the device. Most are triggered by the wire being jerked or pulled; those which are held
taut often will also be triggered by the wire being cut or broken. Trip wires may be
detected by good observation or by the use of a wand to probe areas before you move
into them. Likely locations for trip wires are across doorways and other entryways, they
may also be stretched across rooms or hallways or even strung between items of furni-
ture or other objects.

###### 4.6.2: Motion Detectors

Motion detectors come in two forms. One - such as a passive infra-red detector - will
sense movement in the vicinity of the device. These are difficult to detect unless you are
able to spot the sensor. The only defence against such a device is to stay out of its range
of detection.

The other form of motion detector senses when the device itself is moved. These can
take the form of tremblers or tilt switches, usually mounted internally. Do not attempt to
move any suspect device, as you will not be able to tell whether or not such an item has
been fitted.

###### 4.6.3: Pressure Sensors

Again there are two forms of pressure sensor. One - the pressure mat or pad - responds
to pressure being applied to it, e.g. if it is stepped on. They may be placed as remote
triggers to a booby trap device, or as part of the protection around a device placed where
you are likely to stand or kneel when examining the device. Such pressure pads are
usually concealed under matting, carpets or debris - use a pole or very gentle handling to
move such items before stepping into a suspect area.

The second form of pressure sensor reacts when weight is removed from it, for example,
when you lift an item. The item lifted may be the suspect device itself, or it may be some-
thing else which has been placed to tempt you, which has the pressure sensor and the
charge hidden underneath it. Caution should be exercised before any item is moved;
including a thorough visual inspection. If you must move anything, it is preferable that you
do so remotely - with a pole or a hook and line - from a position of safety.

###### 4.6.4: Light Sensors

Light sensors are sometimes placed within a device, so that they will be exposed to light
during the process of defusing it. Very low light levels may bypass such exposure, or if
such a sensor is spotted it may be covered before light strikes it. A light sensor may also
be situated underneath an item, to be exposed when the item is moved. Beware of dimly-
lit or darkened rooms.

###### 4.6.5: Dealing With Anti-handling Devices

The best way to deal with an anti-handling device is to leave it alone. If you suspect that
you have found one, clear the area and summon assistance. If items have to be moved,
do so with caution and preferably remotely from a position of safety.

##### 4.7: Reporting procedures

At this stage in your EOD career, your primary duty is to observe thoroughly and to report
your findings verbally to your commander, and to the EOD Specialist who will deal with
any suspect devices that you discover. Remember that any detail, however small and
insignificant it may be, could make all the difference to the success or otherwise of the
defusing operation.

### 5: Review

An Explosives / Ordnance Disposal Specialist

- is familiar with and can implement search and containment procedures
- should be able to recognise explosives types
- advises mission commanders
- must report to the ranking EOD Specialist in detail to facilitate defusing of a
device

### 6: Assessement

Following the instructional session(s), the prospective EOD specialist is required to take
and pass both assessed practical and written examinations before he or she is granted
the Explosives / Ordnance Disposal Level 4 qualification.
