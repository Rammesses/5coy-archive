concepts of computer technology. Passing this course gualifies the
marine for issue of standard computer equipment and initial examination
of any captured equipment during a mission.

Comp-Tech qualification level 2 is the intermediate level course, which
centres on programming the standard issue personal computer,
fundamentals and recognition of advanced computer equipment and basic
data analysis and cryptology. Marines passing this course are cleared
to be issued and use advanced equipment, to use remote data links and
to attempt to decrypt encrypted data. High evaluation scores in Comp-
Tech 3 and Comms-Tech 2A are required for acceptance on this course.

Comp-Tech qualification level 1 is the highest level course, and
centers on programming artificially intelligent machines and how to
interact with them, advanced data analysis and cryptology, and
instrustor training for Comp-Tech qualification levels A to Z and 3.
Marines passing this course are cleared to train others to the
afforementioned levels of qualification, and to evaluate performance in
the examinations for those course levels. High evaluation scores in
Comp-Tech 2 and Information-Analysis 1 are required for this course. A
