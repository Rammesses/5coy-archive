### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: Incapacitating Radiation

As a Med-tech Grade 1 you are able to deal with casualties from IR with ail the blue,
green and orange dots removed from their IR monitoring cards, but who still have red
dots on their monitoring cards.

The procedure is identical as for Med-Tech 4, 3 and 2. However, when the patient comes
round they will still need looking after as disorientation, nausea, blurred vision, body
trembling and balance problems will occur and may persist for a short while.

if the patient has only one red dot left you will need a different procedure to deal with the
patient, Nerve Re-alignment. Nerve Re-alignment can also be used to deal with
Diazamorphite. This procedure requires equipment that cannot be taken out in the field,
so the patient will need to be evacuated back to base. Before the evacuation however
you will need to stabilise the patient with resus drugs, or Diazamorphite. You must not
use Cycclazine to stabilize the patient.

Note: You must still remove the top dot from the IR monitoring card and return the card.

##### 4.2: Administration

Every time you treat a patient you must keep accurate records of what is wrong with the
patient and what action you take. As a Med- Tech 1 you will have a number of procedures
and drugs that you are qualified to use, but records must be kept.

As a Med-Tech 1 there are a number of types of administration you must keep. They
must be as up to date as possible at all times.

- When issued with medical drugs and equipment you must sign for them. If
you give any of your drugs or equipment to another Med-Tech they must
sign for it.

- After you have resuscitated a patient you must record patients name, the IDP
reading (see later) and the drugs you administered. This information
goes into the patient's Medical Log.

- When ever an overdose, deliberate or accidental occurs the Overdose
Report form and the patient's Medical Log must be filled in.

- When the Emergency Override Procedure is used all the information on the
Overdose Form must be filled in, and the patient’s Medical Log filled in.

- Negligent discharge of IR weapons is a disciplinary offense under CMC
regulations. If you witness an act of negligent discharge, you must report
it to the senior Med-Tech and the senior officer on duty in writing.

- After Diazamorphite is administered you must fill in a Diazamorphite Report
Form and fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After the CIM Procedure has been done you must fill in the CIM Report Form,
Diazamorphite Report form (if used), and the patient's Medical Log.

- After Cycclazine has been administered you must fill in a Cycclazine Report
Form and fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After using the Anti-biots you must fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After Tranquilisers have been administered you must fill in the Tranquiliser
Report Form and the patient's Medical Log.

- After Analgesics have been administered you must fill in the patient's Medical
Log.

- After treating a patient for a Burn you must fill in the Burn Report Form, the
patient's Medical Log and the report forms for any other drugs or treat-
ments used.

- Every 24 hours the designated Med-Tech Grade 2 must fill in a HRL Form
and pass it to the senior Med-Tech on duty.

- Every 24 hours you must calculate the H/R level using the HRL Form. If
necessary then administer the Desamine series, ensuring the patient’s
Medical Log is filled in.

- When H/R levels are 25% over the norm or 75+ HQ must be informed along
with all the data collected for the HRL Form. You may have to do more
samples for HQ to plot what is happening in the area.

lf you fail to keep you Administration in order you are liable to have your Med-Tech status
revoked and may face further disciplinary action.

As a Med-Tech 1 you are prohibited from carrying or administering any drugs other than
those specifically mentioned in the Med-tech notes, unless given written permission by an
officer or a doctor.

##### 4.3: Hard Radiation Assessment

It is the responsibility of the Medical Division to monitor the levels of hard, background
radiation (H/R) at 0900 every day. You should either complete a HRL Form or arranged
for a Med-Tech Grade 2 to do one. Using this report form you must follow the procedure
below. 

###### 4.3.1: Calculation

Using that days reading calculate the H/R level as shown below:
(Air Reading + Ground Reading + Water Reading)/3

Using the H/R level you must then calculate the amount H/R which will be absorbed by
personnel, and give them any drugs that are necessary. Use the formula below to calcu-
late the absorption rate.

H/R Level x 4 = Absorption Rate

Patient’s NVR
Eg. For a patient NVR rating of 5, in an area with a H/R level of 60:

60 x 4 = 48

###### 4.3.2: Treatment for High H/R Levels

To treat high H/R level there are currently three drugs issued to deal with the radiation.
Using the patient's absorption rate will dictate which of the three are to be used. The
drugs, the Desamine series, need renewing every 24 hours.

+--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
| Drug Name          | Patient’s Absorption Rate | Form          |
+====================+===========================+===============+
| Desamine (b)       | 21 - 44 (Low)             | Green liquid  |
+--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
| Super-Desamine (b) | 45-74 (medium)            | Red liquid    |
+--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
| Hyper-Desamine (b) | 75 - 124 (high)           | Blue liquid   |
+--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
| None available     | 125+  (very high)         | Evacuate area |  
+--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+

Ensure that after administering any of the Desamine series that the patient’s Medical Log
is filled in.

##### 4.4: Anti-Biots

A general purpose (external) anti-biot is provided to reduce the risk of infection after a
breach of corporal integrity. However, there may be cases where there is a possibility of a
wound having already become infected, or where there is a reasonable risk of internal
infection, which a spray cannot deal with.

To cope with such a situation , a series of drugs have been developed and are currently
in use within the Corps. Those available at Grade 1 are as follows.

+---------------+------------------+----------------+
| Drug          | Area of Effect   | Form           |
+===============+==================+================+
| Gastro-Cyllin | Digestive System | Flat green tab |
+---------------+------------------+----------------+
| Neuro-Cyllin  | Nervous System   | Flat red tab   |
+---------------+------------------+----------------+

- Gastro-Cyllin  - An anti-biot designed to cope with infections of the diges-
tive system, usually administered where food/water poisoning is
suspected, and following major breaches of CIM in the abdomen area.

- Neuro- Cyilin  - An anti-biot designed to cope with infections of the nervous
system, symptoms involving: spasms, twitches, frothing, rolling eyes, or
rigidity, where all the muscles are locked.

The Cyllin series can be used in conjunction with each other but a patient should have no
more than 3 doses of any one Cyyllin series drug in 24 hours.

The Cyllin series must be kept in a sterile, airtight container,and handling should be kept
to minimum. If the heat-sensitive coating is marred in any way, then the tab should not be
used, and the entire batch returned to the medical stores for disposal.

It must be noted these drugs are arresting drugs, and the patient may still need proper
medical attention.

After administering any of the Cyllin series ensure you fill in the patient’s Medical Log,
and any other forms for treatments or drugs that have been used, eg CIM.

##### 4.5: Analgesics

Analgesics are drugs that relieve pain. Med-Tech 1's have access to another strong form
of analgesic, Miracaine. This acts as a local anesthetic at the site of the pain.

Miracaine comes in two forms:

* Miracaine (b) - Amber liquid, injected at the pain site.
* Miracaine (Ss) - Spray, use at pain site, not for use near eyes.

Miracaine does not interfere with consciousness.

In 24 hours no more than 3 doses of Miracaine should be administered.

After administering a Analgesic ensure the patients Medical Log is filled in.

##### 4.6: Nerve Re-alignment:

This a surgical procedure where a drug from the series of Cloretrophins is given by injec-
tion into the blood stream. A probe is inserted into the cerebral cortex and ground plates
are attached to hands,feet and temples. A low voltage is then sent through the nervous
system, freeing the nerve endings and encouraging the regeneration of the nerve recep-
tors.

During this process the patient must be unconscious and constantly monitored to ensure
that a stable electrical stimulation takes place. The procedure takes approximately 20
minutes, but a recovery period of 40 minutes is then necessary. Recuperation of around 7
days is then advised, while the body finishes stabilizing the production and levels of
Banatrophin and Diazatrophin.

###### 4.6.1: Cloretrophins

There are many different Cloretrophins on the market. They have two main properties in
common:

As an electrical current distorts the nerve ends the Cloretrophin latches itself on to all the
chemicals released and renders them harmless allowing them to be excreted in the
normal manner.

Causes a temporary halt in the production of Banatrophin and Diazatrophin.

###### 4.6.2: Operating Nerve re-alignment

See manufacturer's instructions and receive training from qualified user before use.

##### 4.7: GVA-27 Unit

The GVA-27 Unit allows you to bypass the SRP when dealing with a patient with IR
damage. There are various models available and if available you will need to refer to the
instructions before using it. You will still need to run the IDP or use Cycclazine.

##### 4.8: Side Effects of Drugs

With the wide array of drugs that are issued in modern wartare,the potential for adverse
reactions amongst patients from widely differing cultures cannot be ignored. To reduce
the risk of non-beneficial side effects, the administration of drugs to each patient must be
strictly monitored, and therefore accurately recorded.

A running log of major drugs is kept for each patient, and this must be reviewed daily.
The danger level of each drug for a particular patient's gene type and NVR rating can be
found in the Drug Information Book. If the patient's dose is getting near this level or
above, then a doctor and the unit CO must be informed.

Other potential problems can occur when a patient develops a tolerance to a drug, or
when the drug itseif begins to accumulate in the body.

Information about the potential side effects of drugs issued by the CMC is restricted. Any
information that you may receive about such effects must regarded as being classified,
and therefore discussion of such effects with unauthorized personai will be considered a
disciplinary offense and lead to revoking of Med-Tech status.

##### 4.9: Drug Tolerance

Drug tolerance occurs as the body adapts to the actions of a drug. The patient will require
larger and larger doses to achieve the original effect; but as the dose increases, so does
the risk of toxic effects and dependency. It is therefore vital that the patient's reactions on
taking each drug are noted if there are any irregularities and reported to a doctor.

##### 4.10: Accumulation

In addition to the risk of a patient developing a tolerance to a drug, there is also a danger
that the drug may accumulate within the patient's tissues. Most people are able to expel
any excess drugs through their liver and kidneys, but in some cases the bodies proces-
ses can be interrupted, and the drug will begin to accumulate.

This can be due to the amount of the drug the liver has to process, the drug disguises
itself so avoiding being expelled, or as the liver can only deal with one drug at a time, so
any other drugs in the system have to wait in the blood, giving the drug time to be
absorbed by the body.

lf there is dangerous levels of a drug present the symptoms may show in various ways,
depending on what drug or drugs have accumulated. If what is generally known as “Toxic
shock’ is occurring, you should immediately arrange to have the patient evacuated to a
proper medical facility.

If for any reason you are unable to get the patient to a medical facility, you should avoid

giving the patient any drugs. Also do not allow them to eat or drink any thing. Though
they should drink pure, clean, sterile water to help flush their system out.

### 5: Review

A Med-tech 1:

- is able to deal with almost all battlefield injuries.
- must deal with Hard Radiation.
- must keep a units medical administration up to date
- must ensure the lower ranked Med-Tech’'s are doing their duties correctly.

### 6: Assessed Written Examination

Following instructional session(s), the prospective Med-Tech 1 is required to take and
_ pass a written examination before he or she is granted the qualification.
