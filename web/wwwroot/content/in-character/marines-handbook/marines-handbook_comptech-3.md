##### 4.1:Introduction to current computer technology

At the time of production of this document, computer technology
allows a Marine to have literally in his pocket an advanced
computer with dedicated text storage and retrieval facilities
that can be additionally programmed for almost any conceivable
operation.

Fixed base computer facilities and now even ground mobile
computers may now include artificially inteligent machines
capable of intuitive data connections and recal at speeds far
surpassing the human brain. This technology is detailed in higher
qualification levels of this course.

In the most part, Marines will deal almost exclusively with SIPC
units. Occasionally, however, more powerful machines will be
encountered and these too are covered in the higher qualification
levels of this course.

At this time, storage capability falls into two categories -
portable storage devices with capacity up to 1G (1 million pages)
and ground fixed devices with capacity into the millions of
Gigabytes (10%6G).

##### 4.2: Introduction to the Standard Issue Personal Computer

The standard issue personal computer, hereafter refered to as the
S.I.P.C., 18 a ruggedised version of the Organiser II computer,
manufactured by the Psion Corporation of Earth. The Organiser II
was introduced 10 years ago, and 1s now the de-facto standard for
personal computing throughout the Imperium. Although there are
other similar devices from other corporations, the Psion range is
in the most widespread use.

Following trials of all available types, the Joint Imperial
Forces Committee for Procurement af. FoF UC. PS chose the
ruggedised SIPC versions of the Psion Organiser II range as the
workhorse of the Imperial Forces.

As a personal computer the Psion range offers unrivaled power,
storage capability and flexibility, as well as the ruggedness to
survive use in battlefield situations.

The compact design allows the SIPC to be stowed in all but the
smallest pouct or pocket, whilst the slide-on cover protects the
device and prevents inadvertent operation of the keys.

All SIPCs have onboard memory for read-write access, and two
cartrige ports for data-packs. The data-packs may be read-write
(named RAM-Packs) a write-once-read-many-times (named
Data_Packs). See the section on external storage devices below
for a more detailed study of the use of data-packs.

The SIPC range consists of four types of computer. The CM type is
the bottom of the range machine, with 16K (about 16 pages of A4
text) of useable memory and a two-line display. The XP type has
32K of memory, but is otherwise identical to the CM type. These
two types form the .SiIPC-8 droup.: SiPC-B group computers are
limited in the storage size of the data-packs that can be used.
The largest pack that can be used on an SIPC-B computer is 64K.

The SIPC-A group consists of two variants on the LZ type. The LZ
type has 32K of internal storage and a four-line display. The LZ-
64 type has 64K of internal storage. The SIPC-A computers can use
larger data-packs than the SIPC-B group, up to a maximum of 256K
per pack.

Unfortunately, many programs written on the four-line SIPC-A
computers will not work on SIPC-B computers without modification,
and care should be taken to ensure that when evaluating a program
found on a data-pack that an SIPC-A computer be used wherever
possible.

##### 4.3: Basic Use of the Standard Issue Personal Computer

The SIPC is activated by pressing the ON button at the top-left
of the keyboard. The SIPC puts itself into a powered down state
after five minutes of inactivity, and may be brought back to
active status by pressing the ON key once. Note that the ON key
doubles as a CANCEL/CLEAR key, and thus should only be pressed
once to bring the SIPC online.

It should be noted that SIPC-A computers have an inbuilt password
system requiring the userto enter the correct password before the
SIPC may be brought online. Although this facility may not always
be enabled, if it is there is no way to bring the SIPC online
without knowing the password and without destroying all the data
stored in the SIPC internal storage device. The procedure to
power up an SIPC-A computer in such a state should only be
performed by a Comp-Tech Level 2 or higher qualified person.

If the SIPC was not waiting for a user input when it powered
down, the user will be presented with the Main-Menu when the SIPC
is brought online. The operation of the SIPC is menu based, and
menu selection is performed by using the arrow keys on the top
row of the keyboard to position the cursor over the required menu
selection and pressing the EXE key at the bottom right of the
keyboard to execute that selection. In most cases the ON key will
cancel the current selection and return the user to the menu from
which the selection was made.

###### 4.3.1: Use of Pre-prepared Programs

Preprepared programs may be found on a captured SIPC. They
may have been entered intothe main menu, or may be hidden,
having no menu entry. The location of hidden programs is
covered in the Comp-Tech Level 2 course.

If the name of a hidden program is known (or suspected),
however, the program may be placed into the main-menu by
pressing the MODE key (at the top-left of the keyboard).
The user is then asked to type in the name of the program,
pressing enter to finish the entry. On SIPC-A computers
only, the user is then presented with a menu to select the
type of menu item to add. Programs are coded as OPL on this
menu.

The name typed is then inserted in the main-menu at the
cursor position, and may be selected and executed in the
normal manner.

If the name of the program was incorrect (whether typed
incorrectly or otherwise) the SIPC will respond with an
error message when the user tries to execute that
selection. The error message will read "MISSING PROC name"
and require the user to press a key to continue, and then
return the user to the main menu.

If all is well, the selected program will execute. After
execution, the program should return control to the main-
menu.

Any menu item (except OFF) may be deleted from the main
menu by positioning the cursor over the item and pressing
the DEL key at the bottom left of the keyboard. The SIPC
then prompts the user to confirm this action by pressing Y
to confttrm the delete, or N to: cancel and return to the
main menu.

Use of particular programs is covered in the support
documentation for each program.

###### 4.3.2: Data Entry and Storage on SIPC Storage Devices

The SIPC has a simple facility for storing text data for
recall later. This facility is available through the SAVE
item on the main-menu. If this item is not on the main-menu
it may be inserted using the procedure above. All SIPCs
have the SAVE program on board.

Upon executing the SAVE program, the display will show the
message "Save on n:" where n: is the currently selected
storage device - A: for the internal storage device, and B:
or C: Eor the first (top) .and. second (botton) data-pack
ports respectively. The user may cycle throught the
available storage devices using the MODE key. If a port has
no data-pack plugged into it, that device will not be
available for use.

The user may now enter text using the keyboard, using the
arrow keys to move around. If the user types off the right-
hand side of the screen, the display will scroll to
accomodate. To move onto a new line, press the down-arrow
Key.

Pressing EXE then stores the text on the selected storage
device. Pressing the ON/CLEAR key deletes all the text.
Pressing the same key when no text has been entered returns
the user to the main-menu.

###### 4.3.3: Data Retrieval from SIPC Storage Devices

Data 1s retrieved from the SIPC text data storage facility
using the FIND command from the main menu. Upon executing
the program, the user is prompted for a search string and
which storage device to search with the message "Find in
n:" where n: is the device name as discussed in section
4.2.2 above. Pressing the MODE key cycles throught the
available storage devices in the same manner as in the SAVE
program.

Pressing the EXE key without entering any search text will
command the SIPC to display in chronological order of entry
the contents of the SIPC storage device, with the user
pressing the EXE key to move on to the next entry in the
device.

Tf the user entered text to be searched for (pressing the
EXE to start the search), then the FIND program will act as
if only entries containing that search string had ever been
made, until the search string is cleared.

The up and down arrow keys may be used to scroll through
multi-line entries, and any line longer thean the width of
the display will scroll sideways cyclicly when selected.

Pressing EXE to move on past the last available entry will
produce the message "NO MORE ENTRIES" and the search string
DFroOMpre .

At the prompt, the ON/CLEAR key, will clear any entry in
the search string prompt, or if the prompt is already clear
return to the main menu.

The FIND program may also be used to edit data already
entered into the SIPC. After finding the required entry,
pressing the MODE key switches into an equivalent of the
SAVE program with the data for that entry already
available. As before, the arrow Keys may be used to move
around the text and the EXE key finishes the data entry.

###### 4.3.4: Data Transfer between SIPC Storage Devices

The transfer of data from the volatile internal storage
device (A:) of an SIPC and a non-volatile data-pack is
often vital to ensure the security of data. The transfer of
data is performed using the FIND command from the main-
menu.

The user finds the reguired entry and presses the MODE key
as if to edit the entry. At this point, pressing the MODE
key cycles through the available storage devices. If a new
device is selected and the EXE key pressed to end the edit
session, then the entry will be copies to a different
device. See sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 above for more
detailed descriptions of the edit procedure.
