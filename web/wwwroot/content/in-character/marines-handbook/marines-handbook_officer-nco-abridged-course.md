### 2. THE MASTER PRINCIPLE OF WAR

There are many principles of war, but most authorities agree that there is one principle that dwarfs all
others in importance. This 'master' principal is stated as:

‘Selection and maintenance of the aim'

Discussion of master principle and commas of success through following: if and disaster by
ignoring it.

### 3. COMMUNICATIONS

##### Introduction

A leader (whether a General or Acting MFC) ideally needs to possess many qualities. For example,
knowledge of weapon system capabilities and hence tactics, personal integrity, courage, physical
_ fitness, intelligence, the ability to communicate, attention to detail, charisma, reliability etc.

Of these properties, whilst all are desireable, arguably the most critical is the ability to communicate.
After all, if one imagines a leader with the analytical ability of a supercomputer combined with a
superior grasp of tactics, but unable to communicate, such a leader would create a perfect plan yet the
individuals concerned would be unaware of their part in it. Such a plan would be doomed to failure.

Alternatively, even a mediocre plan stands some chance of success if it is well executed, and this can
only happen if everyone involved knows exactly what they must do. This is clearly reliant on the leader
possessing adequate communications skill.

The contents of this section of the course are as follows:

- The human being as an information processing machine.
- Military organisational structure.
- Your role as an NCO.
- Your role as an Officer.
- Briefings.
- Debriefings.
- Admonishments / Praise.
- Summary

##### The Human Being As An Information Processing Machine

In order to carry out any skill effectively, one must understand ones limitations in that field.
For example, to be a good Med Tech 4 a marine must not only know how to operate the RVC
and administer resuscitants, but also when to call a higher grade medic for assistance. If you
drive too fast for your ability on a slippery surface you will probably crash, if you engage
someone stronger and better trained in hand to hand combat you will probably lose. All of
these are everyday examples of how exceeding ones limitations will lead to failure. As human
beings, we have some basic ‘built in' physical and psychological limitations as to how we
communicate. If these are not appreciated, then communications between us will be less
effective than they might otherwise.

In order to appreciate our limitations, we will use a simplified model of how a person
operates.

A person has several ways of taking information in, via their senses. Once the information has
been taken in, it is processed and/or stored in memory. On that basis, decisions may be taken
and actions carried out. Without going into an in depth study of how this process works, what
it boils down to is that most people have the ability to deal with about 3 or 4 routine things at
once, these are sometimes referred to as 'decision channels’.

When someone is presented with some information or a problem which requires action, then if
they have a decision channel available they can start to deal with it. If they are already busy
with several tasks then the new information/problem is either ignored or one of the existing
tasks must be dropped to make a decision channel available.

You have probably seen this happen. Imagine you are driving along in a ground car. You are
carrying a passenger who 1s having a conversation with you. Now, performing a relatively
complex task like driving occupies a fair proportion of your decision making ability. It could
perhaps be thought of as two tasks, control of direction and control of speed. So, if the
average person can do three things at once, then they ought to be able to talk at the same time.
In fact, we know from experience that this is the case.

But let us consider what happens when you approach a hazard on the road (perhaps an

erratically moving vehicle in front). As you recognise the threat you start to consider whether

to brake, change lanes or take some other form of action. What may well happen next is that
once the hazard is avoided you suddenly become aware that you stopped your conversation
(perhaps in mid sentence) whilst dealing with the threat. This is a classic example of dropping
an activity due to an overloading of decision channels.

There is the alternative scenario of course - being busy with handling the car as well as talking
to your passenger you fail to appreciate the threat and carry on talking. By your failure to drop
a low priority task for a more urgent one, an accident is more likely.

How then does this relate to communications? Well, if the average human can only keep track
of 3 or 4 things continuously, it follows that the average field commander can only keep
continuous track of 3 or 4 subordinate units at once. As the number of subordinate units is
increased, the quality of communication degrades rapidly. Through training we can improve
the quality of communication but not the ammount, since the number of decision channels
available is determined by our basic mental abilities.

So, we can train someone to communicate more effectively with their subordinates, but we
still can not increase the number of subordinate units without rapid deterioration in
effectiveness.

This leads us to a major conclusion - When tactical operations are conducted, each unit should
consist of no more than 3 to 4 subordinate units.

##### Military Organisational Structure

The need to keep the number of subordinate units to about 3 or 4 has been recognised by most
military planners for the last 600 years or so. It can clearly be seen in the organisation of most
'teeth' arms, with the number of platoons to a company, the number of companies to a
batallion and the number of batallions to a regiment all being usually 3 or 4.

It can also clearly be seen in the organisation of a typical CMC unit, where a company is
comprised of 3 platoons plus an HQ team and each platoon is comprised of 3 squads.
Although each squad is comprised of 2 teams or 8 marines, which would seem to violate the
guidline, in reality marines always work as buddy pairs, and usually as a complete squad, and
hence this is really 4 pairs.

Moving up from company level in the CMC, the idea of 10 companies to a Regiment, with the
concept of a Battalion not regularly being used, may also seem a little strange. However, since
the company is the basic detached unit of the CMC, and is not therefore normally in real time
communication with its superiors, the need for the same ratio is not present. It should be noted
that where the commander is in close proximity to the units in question, Batallion HQ's (such
as the Rapid Response Batallion) are often formed, (both formally and informally) to smooth
communications.

##### Your Role As An NCO

As we have seen, the maximum of things that someone can keep track of at once is about 4.
Hence, it is quite realistic for a platoon commander to keep track of 3 squads, but completely
unfeasable to try and lead 24 individuals.

Hence, your most crucial role as an NCO is as a buffer for information flow between your
superior officers and your subordinate marines. You need to communicate information from
your team/squad to your commander, as well as vice versa. Here are some steps you can take
to achieve this:

**From your team/squad to your CO / Ops:**

* Keep your subordinates under control.

* Insist that your subordinates pass information to you, not direct to the CO,
with the exception of immediate emergencies.
  * You can then ensure that the information is passed to the Ops, and brief the CO
if available (if not, Ops will ensure that the CO is made aware ASAP).
  * This ensures that the CO recieves the information once and once only.

* Do make sure that in your reports you give credit to subordinates where due,
and tell the person concerned that you have done so.

* Make sure that you keep the Ops board updated as to your teams status.

**From your CO / Ops to your team/squad:**

* Check with Ops regularly, before and after every patrol, and as often as
possible in between times.

* Make sure that all critical information is passed on to your marines, 100%
accurately, at the earliest possible opportunity.

* After you have briefed your marines, question them to make sure it has gone in,
(see later section on briefings).

* Try to keep your team/squad as ready as possible at all times, in particular try
to get them to stick together between patrols. For example, you could stake
out a table and get your squad together when eating or having a drink between
patrols. That way, your unit will be in one place and you can brief or update
them without having to waste several minutes getting them together.

* When you are away from your team, perhaps getting briefed by the CO or
checking with Ops, make sure your 2 i/c takes over, keeps your squad together
and does as much preparation as possible for your next duty.

* If you are 2 i/c of a squad, make sure that you keep control of it during the
absence of you leader. For example, when returning from a patrol, as your
leader goes to Ops to check in and pick up the patrol reports, get your squad
together around a table, with a drink, ready to do a debrief. Get your leaders
buddy to get them a drink and a chair ready.

##### Briefings

People are best able to take in information when it is presented to them in a known format. In
recent history, most armed forces have used either a variation or expansion of what is known
as the SMEAC format for briefing. In the absense of any other considerations, it is
recommended that you stick to this format.

* S = Situation
* M = Mission (x2)
* E = Execution
* A = Any Questions?
* C = Check of understanding

**Situation**

Firstly, give your marines all the latest background information, intelligence and Rules Of
Engagement. This section can be very long or very short. Typically, initial briefings pre
insertion are lengthy due to the ammount of background information. Briefings during in a
mission are often somewhat shorter, e.g. "Recce patrols report no enemy sightings since our
last brief".

**Mission**

This is a statement of the aim of the patrol. It must be clear and unambiguous, and should be
as concise as possible. It should be repeated twice, for emphasis, worded exactly the same.
For the following examples, the existance of an enemy position at a grid reference coded as
‘point Yankee’ is assumed to have been covered in 'Situation’.

e.g. (good) - “Mission - Our mission is to capture or kill the enemy at point Yankee ASAP -
Our mission is to capture or kill the enemy at point Yankee ASAP”. This aim of the mission is
clear - the enemy must be captured or killed, (i.e. not allowed to escape). We must do this as
soon as possible.

e.g. (Bad) "We are going to go out there and deal with the enemy”. The aim of the
mission has not been stated. What does "deal with” mean? Kill them? Capture them? Or will it
be enough simply to make them retreat out of the area, or even just drive them out of that
position? Perhaps we are going to do a deal with them? Also, which enemy? The ones at point
Yankee specifically or any that we come across en route? Are there any time constraints
within which we must operate? Finally, the mission has not been repeated, and is less likely to
be firmly fixed in the mind of the marines (although in this case its probably just as well!)

e.g.(Weak) “Mission - Our mission is to engage the enemy at point Yankee - Our mission
is to engage the enemy at point Yankee.” Well, at least we know that we are specifically
going out to fight the enemy at that location. But what is the aim of engaging the enemy? Is it
to destroy them or drive them off? Alternatively, perhaps its just a probe to assess enemy
response times, or maybe it is a diversionary attack. Perhaps command just want us to keep
them pinned down for five minutes, then again maybe they want them pinned down all day.

**Execution**

This section is used to brief what you are going to actually do in order to achieve the mission
aim. It is often best to give a quick overview of the plan and then go into more detail. What
you need to talk about during this section depends very much on what it is you are briefing
for. Guidance for the content of a patrol briefing can be found in the 'Patrolling' course. ©

Try to keep the plan as simple as possible, and consider the likely contingencies. In particular,
if your plan involves splitting your unit make sure you have got the regrouping planned
precisely, including alternative RVs if the primary is compromised.

**Any Questions?**

You should normally ask your marines to hold their questions until this point. Once your
troops get familiar with being briefed in this order they will tend to wait for this section
anyway.

You should strongly resist getting drawn into discussion with one of your marines until this
point. Firstly, you would be surrendering control of the briefing to the marine in question, the
briefing is then in danger of becoming a free for all. Secondly you will probably end up talking
about something you were going to brief on anyway, but now your chain of thought will have
been broken, you might then miss something out or generally give a more confusing briefing.
However, you do not want to disuade your marine from asking questions. So, if a question
gets asked earlier in the brief a polite way of dealing with it is to say something like "Good
point, Bloggs. I'll be covering it later", rather than "Shut up”.

If you've done the brief well, there should not be too many questions in relation to the
complexity of the task. Take a mental note of the sorts of things people ask, and use that to
improve the content and quality of your briefings.

**Check Of Understanding**

Once the marines have finished asking questions, you should check that they have understood
by questioning them on the important points. For example, ask what the mission is, what the
passwords are, when is the patrol departing. In particular:

* make sure that your 2 1/c 1s clear on the plan, as the responsibility for
completing it will fall to him/her should you become a casualty.
* make sure that anyone who has got to take any particular action before
departure is clear about it (e.g. drawing special equipment or medical supplies),
since if that action is not taken, the patrol will be late departing.

The generally accepted technique for such questioning is referred to as the Pose, Pause,
Pounce method.

* Pose - Firstly, ask the question, but do not direct it at anyone in particular.
* Pause - Wait for a few seconds. Since anyone might be asked, everyone tries to think
of the answer.
* Pounce- Name the marine you want to answer.

e.g. _"What is the password ........... Bloggs?”_

This is generally thought to be a much better technique than saying “Bloggs, what is the
password?" because as soon as you say the name, the others can switch off without fear of
getting caught out. Therefore they might miss an important point.

If someone does get a question wrong, if time permits ask them again later on.

##### Debriefings

When debriefing your unit, you should act mostly as a chairperson, directing the flow of the
debrief. Try to keep it chronological so that nothing is left out.

Initially you should ask questions and let your marines answer. Make your own comments
only when they start to run out of observations, otherwise you may find people tend to agree
with you by default. For example, say you thought you saw 3 enemy, but one of your marines
thought he might have seen 3 or 4. If you ask the marine first they will probably say "there
were 3 or 4 enemy”. But if you have already stated that you saw 3, the marine may,
consciously or subconsciously, think that there were only 3 after all and say "there were 3
enemy”. In otherwords, you are more likely to get an unbiased opinion if you let your people
have their say first.

You should not use leading questions, continuing the above example it would be a bad idea to
ask a question like ‘There were only 3 enemy, weren't there?” as that will certainly tend to
make people agree with the statement rather than saying what they thought.

If the debrief is stalling, ask ‘open’ questions. These are questions beginning with What /
When / Why / How / Who / Where / Which. These are more likely to reveal information than
‘closed’ questions which prompt Yes / No answers. For example, if you ask ‘Did you see any
enemy’ the answer might be ‘No’, whereas if you ask 'Who did you see’ the answer might be
‘Well, there weren't any enemy about but I did see some civilians loitering in the area’ |

##### Praise / Admonishment

There are often times when it is neccessary to give praise to one of your marines. Regrettably
there are also occaisions when admonishment is required.

The general rule is "Praise in public, admonish in private".

Without doubt, praise should always be given publically.

Admonishment should ideally be given in private although there are often occaisions when it is
acceptable and more practicable to do so immediately. An example of this would be a minor
infringement such as a marine with equipment not secured on parade.

There is one rule which should never be broken. NEVER chastise someone in the presence of their
subordinates since this will give them a serious credibility problem. For example, it is quite acceptable
for an officer to bollock a marine in the presence of a sergeant, but it would be a serious error to
chastise the sergeant in the presence of a marine.

When admonishing someone, make sure that the recipient is clear about what it is that they have done
that is unacceptable. Bear in mind that the point of telling someone off is to modify their future
behaviour, not extract retribution for a mistake. Hence you should also always try to finish by giving
the person some way of redeeming themselves. Even if you only say something like "Don't let that
happen again or there will be trouble" then at least the person knows that as long as they pull their
finger out that should be the end of the matter, they will then be better able to concentrate on doing their
job.

There are two general methods for dealing with unsatisfactory behaviour. One is to make the person
afraid of you so that the fear motivates them not to do the same thing again. The second is to try to
appeal to the persons sense of self esteem and esprit de corps. Historically, the ‘fear' method has been
used to get quick results but is less effective in the long term than the 'self esteem’ method.

The problem with the 'fear' method is firstly that it builds a layer of antipathy between levels of
command, and secondly that the person concerned will probably still behave in the unwanted manner
whenever they think they can get away with it.

The 'self esteem’ method relies on showing the person how their action (or inaction)
lets their team mates down. Assuming that they have a sense of loyalty to their unit, they will
then be powerfully motivated to do the job correctly, even when you are not looking over
their shoulder. Of course, this all presupposes that the individual has a sense of self worth and
that there is some basis of esprit de corps to build on. These can take some time to build up,
but are a worthwhile investment in a career army such as the CMC.

##### Summary

We have studied how people deal with information and seen how there is a practical maximum
of 3 or 4 tasks which can be dealt with effectively for most individuals. We have seen how this
shapes the organisational structure of many military units, and shown that it is unrealistic to
expect your commanding officer to look after all the marines in your unit continuously. This
has allowed us to see that NCO's are vital to the cohesion of the unit, and that one of the most
important duties of an NCO is to communicate between the officers and marines. We have
then looked at a variety of prectical things that an NCO can do to try and excel in this role,
including routine between patrols, briefing before and debriefing after them, and finally giving
praise and admonishment where appropriate.

### SECURITY

##### Introduction

Most people find it intuitively obvious that there will be sensitive information which needs to be with
held from general release so that hostile intelligence services are unable to gather it. Hence it is fairly
obvious that measures will need to be taken to protect information, by restricting access to it and
distribution of it.

What is often overlooked by the laymen is that Security is a two edged sword. There is no virtue in
having gathered information or produced intricate operational plans, unless they are made available to
those personnel that need them. In fact, the primary basis of military security is referred to as the 'Need
To Know’ principle.

This section discusses the 'need to know’ principle, the security classifications which are used by the
CMC to grade classified material, as well as the security clearances which are used to vet personnel for
access to that material.

##### The 'Need To Know’ Principle

Information is divulged to personnel if and only if they actually 'need to know' it to perform
their duties. Similarly, superiors must ensure that their subordinates have been given all
information relevant to the execution of their mission, including likely contingencies. This is
sometimes inapropriately taken to mean that a unit should simply be given an objective and
told to achieve it. In reality it is highly advisable to give the unit the background information
since this will help in the maintenance of morale as well as allowing the unit to react to
changes in circumstances. Basically, the more information is given the greater the chance that
some of it will be compromised, but the greater the effectiveness of the unit will be.

Hence it can be seen clearly that one of the most important duties of a commander is ensuring
that the relevant information is deseminated.

##### Security Classifications

Within the United Worlds Forces, including the CMC, there are 6 grades of security classification. All
material has one of these classifications. They are as follows:

* Unclassified
* Confidential
* Classified
* Secret
* Most Secret
* Top Secret

**Unclassified** - This covers material which either has no military/personal value or is so well known
that security measures are inappropriate.

Example: The fact that 5 Coy 4 Fld Regt are assigned to the UWS 'Garavaglia 2' is unclassified
because it is so well known, in spite of the fact that it has significant military value since an agressor
meeting 5 Coy on planet knows that there is a high probability that a Cruiser class starship is in the
vicinity.

Example: The exact mixture to give the correct shade of gray for the paint used on the exterior of
a dropship is not widely known, yet since it has no military value to an agressor it is unclassified.

**Confidential** - This covers material which has no particular military value, yet is of personal
significance to one or more members of UW forces. Revelation of such information would not aid the
enemy, but would prove embarassing to the individual concerned.

Example: Routine medical records are confidential, since someone would hardly wish to read
about the details of their medical condition on the front cover of a newspaper.

Example: Names of casualties would be (at the very least) confidential until the next of kin have
been informed, to avoid unneccessary distress being caused to them.

**Classified** - This covers material which has military significance, yet has no particular importance in
itself. Revelation of such material would not directly compromise a mission, but might allow a hostile
intelligence service to gain some insight as to the abilities and disposition of a unit.

Example: Supply uplifts, even of routine consumables, by Fleet starships are (at least)
classified. Analysis of the supplies uplifted, in comparison to the size of the crew, give some indication
as to the endurance of the ship. Hence, although the enemy are not able to gauge what we intend the
vessel to actually do, they may be able to estimate what it could do.

Example: Routine training material (for example Basic Training Notes) is classified. We do not
wish the enemy to easily access our techniques and methods. However, the enemy could take an
educated guess, and the material is often so widely distributed that higher classification is not practical.

**Secret** - This covers material which has direct significance to the conduct or planning of a military
activity, revelation of which would give the enemy an indication of our intended actions.

Example: After several encounters with hostile troops, a squad leader recommends (in writing, in
a patrol report) that recconaisance patrols should be sent to ascertain the location of the enemy base so
that it can be assaulted. This patrol report should be classified secret since the enemy would be able to
adjust their activities to suit.

**Most Secret** -This covers material which actually details a planned military activity. Revelation of
these plans would allow the enemy to counter that activity directly. Hence it would offer an enemy a
tactical advantage in part of a conflict, but would not directly compromise the defensive strategy of the
United Worlds.

Example: Plans for an assault, detailing numbers of troops, planned LZs and times of insertion,
would be classified (at least) most secret. Obviously, if the plans fell into enemy hands they would be
able to have troops dug in waiting, with interlocking fields of fire which would probably doom the
assault to failure.

Example: Daily IFF codes for Fleet starships.

**Top Secret** - This covers any material which would seriously damage the offensive or defensive
strategy of the United Worlds. Revelation of such material would give an agressor a strategic advantage
in a conflict.

Example: Security arrangements for CINCUW. Revelation to an agressor would allow
the enemy to decapitate the UW government.

Example: Defensive plans for the Lumiere and Sol shipyards. Revelation to an agressor
would give them a tactical advantage in an assault, but this would have strategic implications
due to the importance of the shipyards.

##### Summary of Security Grades

The following list summarises what military information an enemy might gain from
intercepting information of the following grade:

* Unclassified - Nothing.
* Confidential - Nothing.
* Classified - Indications of what our units are capable of doing.
* Secret - Indications of what we are planning to do tactically.
* Most Secret  - Indications of how we intend to do it tactically.
* Top Secret - The ability to counter our entire strategy.

**Classified -> Top Secret** - The gradings from Classified through to Top Secret are also used
to classify information which would be damaging / embarassing to the UW government in a
non military manner. The grade used reflects the degree of potential damage, the following
guidlines can be used:

**Classified** - Likely to cause embarrasment to governement.

**Secret** - Likely to damage governments credibility with another.

**Most Secret** - Likely to jeopardise diplomatic relations with another power.
**Top Secret** - Potentially leading to toppling of government


##### Physical Security

**Unclassified** - This material may be freely distributed without any special procedures.

**Confidential** - It is the responsibility of the holder of confidential material to ensure that only
appropriate personnel have access to it, However there are no laid down physical security
measures required.

**Classified** - The material may be distributed to any member of United Worlds forces if the
holder feels the recipient has a need to know tt. It is the responsibility of the holder not to
reveal it or allow it to be revealed to any non service personnel. However, there are no laid
down physical measures required.

**Secret** - Information is distributed on a need to know basis by an NCO or higher. The
material should either be on the person of the holder, or under lock and key, or in the
Operations Centre.

**Most Secret** - Information is distributed on a need to know basis by a commissioned officer
(2 Lt or higher). The material must never be left unattended and should either be on the person
of the holder, or in the Operations Centre (which is attended at all times), or in a secure
storage unit conforming to Mil/Stds/Grade B or higher.

**Top Secret** —- Information is distributed on a need to know basis by a senior commissioned
officer (Maj and above). Multiple copies must be serial numbered, the location of each copy
logged (by operations) by signing in and out procedures. The material must never be left
unattended and should either be on the person of the holder or in a secure storage unit
conforming to Mil/Stds/Grade A.

##### Security Clearances

Every member of UW forces has a personal security clearance. These are in the form of a
colour and a number, for example _Red 2_ or _Blue 4_. The colours extend as follows:

Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Ultraviolet, White.

Where for example Red clearance is lower than orange. Each Colour except black is broken
down into 4 subsidiary levels, numbered from 4 to 1, where 4 is lower than 1. Hence the
lowest security clearance is _Black_, followed by _Red 4_, _Red 3_ .. up to ... _White 2_, _White 1_.
When you attempt to carry out a data search, your clearance influences the degree to which
you can easily obtain information. Having obtained information, you are free to divulge it to
juniors of a lower security clearance if you consider that they ‘need to know’ it in order to
complete their mission, bearing in mind that you may need to justify that decision at a later
date!

Your personal security clearance is set by your superiors. This comprises the extent of
the information which you need to know at this stage.
