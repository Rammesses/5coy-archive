### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: introduction

The fully trained sniper’s most important skill is not accuracy,but being abie to use all the
skills taught to a high standard.All the skills taught in the sniper course and in the cour-
sesleading to it, are vital if the sniper is to be of use to his CO.He must be able to operate
on his own for prolonged periods oftime, not only surviving, but planning and executing
missions.He must be also able to operate with a team.

##### 4.2: A.C.E

A.C.E is an accroym for the three most important elements ofbeing a sniper. When on a
sniping mission always keep it in mind.

###### 4.2.1: A (Address)

Getting to a position where you will be able to fire on targets and still be able to see
around your position, or know the enemy cannot approach from a direction you cannot
cover.

###### 4.2.2: C (Concealment)

Once in position your cover and camouflage must be of a high standard and the position
must be sustainable for long periods of time, for shelter, food and drink and toilet breaks.

###### 4.2.3: E (Escape)

Ensure you can be on the move in seconds if needed and have a number of alternative
routes mentally prepared at all times, not just when you have opened fire. Also do not
Stay in one position to long firing at the enemy. However good your concealment even-
tually they will spot you.

##### 4.3: Use of Spotter

In modern warfare it is recommended that snipers operate inpairs when out on an opera-
tion. One as the shooter and the other as a spotter. The two should swap roles about
every twenty minutes so both remain fresh.

The spotters role is to watch for targets using either telescope or binoculars and keep a
general eye on security. When shots are fired he should be able to inform the sniper of
results.

The spotter also fills in the log of any events that are seen to occur.

Both members of the team should be qualified snipers and know each other and how
each other operate.

### 4.4: Factors Affecting Accuracy

How to look after your weapon is covered in Basic Training and if you are using a snipers
rifle the care you show your weapon should be exemplary if you wish it to retain any sort
of accuracy.

###### 4.4.1: Telescopic Sight

Time and care should be taken to zero in your telescopic sight before going out on a
mission and after it has been set great care must be taken to ensure that it is not altered
as a misaligned sight will make firing your weapon a pointless exercise.

As IR beams fire a straight beam, unaffected by wind or gravity you do not have com-
pensate at different ranges, so the sight should be set to be accurate a the maximum
range of the weapon and then at closer ranges it will still be accurate.

###### 4.4.2: Weather

IR beams accuracy are not affected by the weather, fog,rain etcbut the range of the IR
beam can be severely reduced in such conditions.

###### 4.4.3: Sunshine

IR beams accuracy are not affected by strong sunlight but if you are firing into the sun,
not only is it harder to see the target but the range of the IR beams is reduced, so try to
avoid firing into the sun.

###### 4.4.4: Terrain

Even light foliage can deflect an IR beam therefore it isimportant fo make sure you have
as Clean a line of sight as possible between you and your target.

###### 4.5: Target Priority

Unless you have a mission specific target priority the firsttarget to eliminate is:
1. Officers and senior NCOs, who may be denoted by rank insignia but if you
have time to observe the targets the behavior of people around them
should give them away eg. saluting, or their behavior eg. giving orders.

2. Snipers, may be obvious by rifles with telescopic sight and ghille suits.

3. Main radio operators, who can often been seen by either the aerial or if
that is concealed by the size of their backpack.

4. Heavy weapon operators.

5. Medical Technicians, these can usually only be identified once an enemy
unit has taken casualties and they start dealing with the wounded.

6. Specialists, they would be identified usually by the equipment that they are
carrying.

7. Any other troops that present a good target.

##### 4.6: Deployment of Snipers

Snipers within the CMC are deployed at Company level with the company CO issuing
orders to the sniper. The range of missions may vary from strategic eliminations to help-
ing in a platoon attack or defense.

A sniper skill’s in camouflage and concealment will make him often be used as a Scout
as the ability to shoot the enemy without be seen means he is able to observe without
being seen.

Whatever type of mission a sniper has been tasked with it is vital he knows as much
about the situation as possible as once in the field the situation may alter and without the
knowledge of what is going on around him the sniper has no guide on whether his orders
are still valid.

##### 4.7: Counter-Sniper

lf your unit is under fire from a Sniper as opposed to a well hidden enemy soldier you
would be tasked to deal with him as a sniper yourself.

The only method to track down an enemy sniper is to put yourself in his mind and work
out where he is firing from, and is likely to move to. Once this has been achieved put your
self in a position where you will be able to see and fire at him You should assume the
enemy sniper is aware of your presence.

The only way to become proficient in dealing with enemy snipers is to become an excel-
lent sniper in your own right, having mastered all the skills required and practice.

### 5: Review

A marine qualified as Sniper should be able prepare for and then move around the bat-
tlefield as ordered without being seen,observing the enemy and reporting on anything
seen, and eliminate any targets of opportunity or as ordered without being discovered.

### 6: Assessed Written and Practical Examination

Following instructional session(s) you are required to take a written examination and
practical examination before being granted the Sniper qualification.
