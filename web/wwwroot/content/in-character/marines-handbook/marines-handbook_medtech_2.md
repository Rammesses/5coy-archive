### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: Incapacitating Radiation

As a Med-tech Grade 2 you are abie to deai with casualties from IR with all the biue,
green and orange dots removed from their IR monitoring cards. If they have only red dots
left you will need a higher grade Med-Tech to deal with the patient.

The procedure is identical as for Med-Tech 4 and 3. When the patient comes round they
will need looking after as disorientation, nausea, biurred vision, body trembling and
balance problems will occur and may persist for a short while.

lf the symptoms are severe you may need to place them in the recovery position and
treat them for shock (see Med-Tech 3 notes, CMC95/1M0102), for as long as the
symptoms persist.

Note: You must still remove the top dot from the [R monitoring card and return the card.

When personnel are hit by Incapacitating Radiation (IR), whether shielded or not, the IR
causes an electrical storm in the brain. To protect its self the brain releases a chemical,
Diazatrophin, to block the nerve ends and prevent further damage and stimulation. The
larger the dose of IR the iarger the electrical storm and the more Diazatrophin is
released. Eventually there is so much Diazatrophin in the brain that all messages to and
from the brain are stopped and coma followed by death occurs.

At the same time as producing Diazatrophin the brain also produces a second drug
known as Banatrophin, that breaks down the Diazatrophin over a period of time, freeing
the nerve ends up.

##### 4.2: Cycciazine

As a Med-Tech 2 you can be issued with the drug Cycclazine. The drug Cycclazine
resembles Banatrophin in that it attacks the Diazatrophin, but it attacks the Diazatrophin
very quickiy and violently. In effect ripping the Diazatrophin from the nerve endings.
Cycclazine also affects Diazamorphite where as Banatrophin has no effect.

Unfortunately the side effects of Cycclazine include becoming addictive, leading to nerve
damage and various other problems as a toxic residue builds up. More importantly the
body can become immune to the effects of Cycclazine, causing a larger and larger dose
to be needed to induce recovery.

in the fieid you can do nothing about this but if a patient is found to have built up a large
intake of Cycclazine a Doctor will have to be consulted as to the patient having to be
withdrawn from active service, while the toxins and dependencies are treated at a proper
medical! facility.

#####  4.3 Administration

Every time you treat a patient you must keep accurate records of what is wrong with the
patients and wnat action you take. As a Med- Tech 3 you will have a number of
procedures and drugs that you are qualified to use, but records must be kept.

As a Med-Tech 2 there are a number of types of administration you must keep. They
must be as up to date as possibie at ail times.

- When issued with medical drugs and equipment you must sign for them. if
you give any of your drugs or equipment to another Med-Tech they must
sign for it.

- After you have resuscitated a patient you must record patients name, the IDP
reading (see later) and the drugs you administered. This information
goes into the patient's Medical Log.

- When ever an overdose, deliberate or accidental occurs the Overdose
Report form and the patient's Medical Log must be filled in.

- When the Emergency Override Procedure is used all the information on the
Overdose Form must be filled in, and the patient's Medical Log filled in.

- Negligent discharge of IR weapons is a disciplinary offense under CMC
regulations. lf you witness an act of negligent discharge, you must report
it to the senior Med-Tech and the senior officer on duty in writing.

- After Diazamorphite is administered you must fill in a Diazamorphite Report
Form and fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After the CIM Procedure has been done you must fill in the CIM Report Form,
Diazamorphite Report form (if used), and the patient's Medical Log.

- After Cycciazine has been administered you must fill in a Cycclazine Report
Form and fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After using the Anti-biots you must fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After Tranquilisers have been administered you must fill in the Tranquilisers
Report Form and the patient's Medical Log.

- After Anaigesics have been administered you must fill in the patient's Medical
Log.

- After treating a patient for a Burn you must fill in the Burn Report Form, the
patient's Medical Log and the report forms for any other drugs or treat-
ments used.

- Every 24 hours the designated Med-Tech-2 must fill ina HRL Form and pass
it to the senior Med-Tech on duty.

- f you fail to keep you Administration in order you are liable to have your Mea-
Tech status revoked and may face further disciplinary action.

As a Med-Tech 2 you are prohibited from carrying or administering any drugs other than
those specifically mentioned in Med-tech 2 or below, unless given written permission by
an officer or a Med-Tech 1.

##### 4.4: Administering Cycclazine

Under certain circumstances you will be unable to treat a patient with the 3 resus- drugs,
i.e: there are none left, time does not allow it within the 1/2 hour or the patient is allergic
to those drugs. To allow you to deal with this situation a drug known as Cycclazine has
been developed.

Cycclazine is also the only drug outside a full medical facility that can bring a patient
round who has been given Diazamorphite.

When administering Cycclazine you will still need the RVC-877 Unit to do the SRP.
Ensure you do the SRP before administering the Cycclazine.

Note: Cycclazine should not be administered to users of narcotic substances.

A few seconds after the administering of Cycclazine the action of the Diazatrophin being
violently ripped of the nerve endings will cause violent convulsions and the patient should
be restrained during the convuisions so that they do not hurt themselves.

lf the Cycclazine is being used for treatment for Diazamorphite, two doses will need to be
administered.

Cycclazine is currently available in three forms:

Cycclazine (b) - Black liquid.
Cycciazine (i) - Red capsuie.
Cycclazine (s) - Spray

After administering Cycclazine ensure that you fill out a Cycclazine Report Form and the
patient's Medical Log.

##### 4.5: Anti-Biots

A general purpose (external) anti-biot is provided to reduce the risk of infection after a
breach of corporal integrity. However, there may be cases where there is a possibility of a
wound having already become infected, or where there is a reasonable risk of internal
infection, which a spray cannot deal with.

To cope with such a situation , a series of drugs have been developed and are currently
in use within the Corps. Those available at Grade 2 are as follows.

Drug Area of Effect Form
Hemo Cyllin Blood Flat pink tab.
Lymphatic Cyllin Lymphatic system _ Flat blue tab.

###### 4.5.1: Hemo-Cyllin

Hemo-Cyllin is a general anti-biot designed to cope with infections carried in the blood,
usually administered after a minor breach of CIM, where there is a reasonable risk of
infection.

###### 4.5.2: Lymphatic Cyllin

Lymphatic Cyllin is an anti-biot designed to cope with infections of the Lymphatic system,
following major breaches of CIM, etc.

###### 4.5.3: Administering Cyllin Series Drugs

The Cyilin series can be used in conjunction with each other but a patient should have no
more than 3 doses of any one Cyllin series drug in 24 hours.

The Cyllin series must be kept in a sterile,airtight container,and handling should be kept
to minimum. If the heat-sensitive coating is marred in any way, then the tab should not be
used,and the entire batch returned to the medical stores for disposal. It must be noted
these drugs are arresting drugs, and the patient may still need proper medical attention.

After administering any of the Cyilin series ensure you fill in the patient's Medical Log,
and any other forms for treatments or drugs that have been used, eg CIM.

##### 4.6: Tranquilisers

Clinical anxiety arises when the balance between certain chemicals in the brain is dis-
turbed. Fearful feelings increases brain activity, stimulating the sympathetic nervous
system,often triggering off physical symptoms such as shaking, palpitations, breathless-
ness, stomach cramps and headaches.

The only type of tranquilisers available to Med-Tech grade 2 is Kramitone, which is a low
dose anti-anxiety drug. Kramitone is currently available in 2 forms:

Kramitone (b) - Clear liquid.
Kramitone (i) - Flat oblong tab.

Kramitone must not be administered more than once in 4 hours. if more than that is taken
an Overdose Report Form must be filled in and the patient must see a doctor as soon as
practicable.

After administering Kramitone ensure a Tranquiliser Report Form and the patient's
Medical Log are filled in.

Kramitone will not resolve the cause of the patient's problem,and he will need to be
referred to a doctor upon returning to base.

##### 4.7: Analgesics

Analgesics are drugs that relieve pain. Med-Tech 2's have access to one strong form of
analgesic, the Molodite series. These act at the site of the pain, preventing the stimula-
tion of nerve endings by blocking Prostaglandin production.

The two types in the Moloditeseries are:

Riximolodite - Flat yellow tab. for patients NVR 0-4
Nedimolodite - Fiat orange tab. for patients NVR 5-10

It is important to note the patient's NVR rating so you give them the right drug. The
patient must have no more than one dose in 6 hours. After administering a Molodite
ensure the patients Medical Log is filled in.

##### 4.8: Burns

As well as dealing with breaches of corporal integrity, Med-Tech 2's have the added
responsibility of treating any burn injuries that a patient has received. Burns may have
been due to a variety of causes: acid, alkaline, heat (wet or dry) or electrical, but the
procedure below can be followed for all of them.

###### 4.8.1: Types of Burns

The three classifications of burns are:

- Superficial Outer layer of skin, redness, swollen, tender.

- Partial Thickness Raw skin and blisters. Wound may "weep".

- Full Thicknes All layers of skin burnt, may effect nerves,muscle
and fat. Skin appears pale, waxy or charred.

###### 4.8.2: Burns Procedure

- Do not try to treat the patient uniii it is safe to do so.

- 1.. Cool the burn - It may take up to 10 minutes. Wash the burn if acid or
alkaline burn with water or neutralizing agent.

- 2.. Remove clothes and jewelry around burn. If the clothes are stuck to
wound leave the clothes alone.

- 3.. Spray affected area with Synthskin. Not in the face.
- 4,. Check for the onset of shock and treat accordingly. With burns it is allow-
able to let the patient drink, small and frequently as they have to replace

lost fiuids.

- 5.. Treat any other injuries.

- 6.. Evacuate the patient to a proper medicai faciiity.

- After treating the patient make sure a Burns Report Form, the patient's
Medical Log and any other forms are filled in.

##### 4.9: Background Radiation

It is the responsibility of the Medical Division to monitor the levels of background radia-
tion, hard radiation (H/R). This procedure must be carried out at 0900 hrs every day
whatever the unit is doing. If the H/R level is very high, a total reading of above 75, the
monitoring will have to be done every 6 hours.

Only one Med-Tech in the unit needs to do the monitoring, the senior Med-tech will
nominate one of the eligible Med- Techs to carry out the duty.

There are a number of devices to measure the H/R, read the instruction manual or seek
advice before using it.

###### 4.9.1: H/R Monitoring Procedure

- Take air samples - note down H/R level.

- Take ground samples - note down H/R level.

- Take water samples - note down H/R level.

- Note wind speed and direction.

- Note temperature.

- Note unusual weather conditions.

- Compiete HRL Form and pass to the senior ranking Med-Tech on duty.

### 5: Review

A Med Tech 2:

- is responsible for the treatment of IR damage and a wide range of other
injuries.
- is responsible for taking H/R readings if required.
- must keep all records up to date.

### 6: Assessed Written Examination

Following instructional session(s), the prospective Med-Tech 2 is required to take and
pass a written examination before he or she is granted the qualification.
