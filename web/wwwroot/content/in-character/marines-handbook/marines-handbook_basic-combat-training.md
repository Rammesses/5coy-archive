Course CMC95/1C0101 - Basic Combat Training

Document Number 111/001/A

##### Prepared by: Captain Zwalf

### 1: Introduction

##### 1.1: Purpose

The manual is intended as guide to how the Colonial Marine Corps (CMC) operates, from
individual marines up to a full platoon. It is useful as a guide only, as all the techniques and
tactics shown, should work in an ideal world, but military life is far from ideal.

##### 1.2: Your Job

As an individual marine you contribute to the CMC activities and success, hence itt is vital
every marine does the best job that he is able to. To do the best job possible it is vital you
acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to do the job. Working as an effective team
with your fellow marines, being abie to take orders, and give them are important elements
in being a successfui marine.

### 2: Course Description - Your Training

You must learn to be able to operate as a marine in all weathers, climates, gravities, by
night and day. Your missions could involve moving around enemy areas, hence you must
be skilled in moving quietly, taking full advantage of cover and concealment, you must be
able to use maps and compasses,be able to see during the day and night and know what
you are looking at. How to report what you see and hear accurately and succinctly. You
must develop patience, alertness and determination.

This manual will teach you many of the skills you require, experienced officers and NCO’s
will demonstrate and explain what you must learn.

### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: Command Structure.

###### 4.1.1: The Buddy Pair

The most basic unit within the CMC is the “Buddy Pair’, consisting of two marines, who
should stay with each other come what may. The reason for this there is always some one
waiching your back. If you go down, your buddy is there to get medical aid to you, or if you
get left behind, your buddy can inform your CO, so someone can come and find you.
When you have lost your buddy you should inform your CO and attach yourself to another
buddy pair. The senior of the two should be at least a Marine First Class.

###### 4.1.2: The Brick

Next is the “Brick’, which is formed from two buddy pairs, operating together, in a similar
way to the pair. This unit is considered the smallest viable unit on the battle field. The
senior of the four should be at least a Corporal.

###### 4.1.3: The Squad

Next is the “Squad”, which is formed from two Bricks known as the “Tack Team*“ and the
“Fire Team’. These are Bricks as described above - the names are used for inter-squad
communication and organization. The two Bricks should operate together as a buddy pair.
The most senior of the Brick leaders should be at least a Sergeant.

The hand signal for the Tack Team is a clenched fist. The hand signal for the Fire Team is a
hand formed into a pistol shape.

###### 4.1.4: The Platoon

Next is the “Platoon”, which is formed from three squads, known as “HQ Squad”, “Assault
Squad” and “Support Squad”. These squads have differences as will be explained later.
The three squads snouid, as ail its sub-units do, operate as a buddy pair. The most senior
of the squad leaders should be at least a Lieutenant.

The lieutenant may operate with a extra Brick, that is attached to the HQ squad, so the
lieutenant can move from squad to squad with protection, and without reducing the effec-
tiveness of any squad.

###### 4.1.5: The Company

Companies are made up of two or more platoons but never more than five, depending on
the particular mission that is being performed. The company is usually commanded by a
Major with a second-in-command, a Captain. The Major and Captain would operate with a
squad that is extra to the other platoons.

###### 4.1.6: Other Ranks

Other ranks that occur are Master Sergeants who are directly above Sergeants, Sergeant
Major who are above Master Sergeants, Surgeon Lieutenants who in non field activities
are of equal rank to lieutenants, and in medical matters are superior to Captains.

### 4.2: Screens

##### 4.2.1:Introduction

The three most commonly encountered screens are :-

- Military Screen - Usually mounted in a helmet, acts as a personal screen
against incapacitating Radiation (IR). When the screen over-
loads, the wearer has thirty minutes before an irreversible
comma sets in. It is possibile to reset the military screen.

- Civilian Screen - Mounted in various forms, acts as a personal screen against
IR. When the screen overioads, the wearer invariable dies. It is
not possibile to reset the civilian screen.

- Base Screen - Base screens are usually built into the fabric of a building and
need large amounts of power, hence are fairly immobile, also
due to the area they have to cover are not as effective as the
previous screens. Base screens do not fail in the way the
others do however.

##### 4.2.2: Use Of Screens

When using a screen you should ensure :-

* At all times the red dome ts kept clean and clear of obstructions.
* When in a combat area, even if combat Is not occurring, you should
never have the screen outside arms reach.
* When your screen has been damaged due to having received IR fire
have the screen repaired by an armorer at the earliest opportunity.
* When coming into a safe area and swiiching off a screen make sure an
armorer resets the screen.

##### 4.2.3: AIR Drill

In the event that your screen completely malfunctions or you drop it out of reach while IR
weapons are being fired in your vicinity you should go into the Anti Incapacitating
Radiation Drill (AIR Drill).

The drill is to go flat on your face immediately, staying as low as possible, and in cover if
possible. Cover your head with both hands. Call “Medic” as loudly as is necessary for your
squad medic to hear you. Stay in this position till someone comes and either replaces your
screen, or returns your screen to you.

Failure to follow this drill in the middle of combat will result in you becoming a casualty.

### 4.3: Weaponry

##### 4.3.1: Introduction

Modern weaponry fires Incapacitating Radiation (IR), rather than solid projectiles or beams
of high energy. The use or ownership of non-IR weapons is illegal and within the CMC
carries the death penalty. The IR weapon system was adopted after the Colonial War
(2297-2322), when even governmenis realized there nad to be a limit to the damage that
could be done in a coniiict.

###### 4.3.1.1: The Standard Sidearm

The standard military arm at present comes in the form of pistol, with a fairly narrow beam,
single shot, and a maximum range of 100m, an effective range of about 50m. Due to the
relatively low output of these weapons they have a virtually unlimited ammo supply.

###### 4.3.1.2: Other Weapons

However there are many different types aiso in service with maximum ranges up to 400m
and beam widths of up to 60 degrees, though not together. The more powerful weapons do
require frequent power pack changes.

When training, or in a combat area remember at all times the weapon in your hand is
designed to hurt and kill. It is not a toy and should not at any time be treated as such.

##### 4.3.2: Care of Your Weapons

The proper care of your weapon, at all times, is essential if you want it to do its job.

1. Keep the weapon clean and dry.
2. Keep the lens clear and clean. What is known as “grounding” is what
most commonly blocks the lens of weapons. This is when either diving to
the ground or getting up from the ground the muzzle of the weapon is
pushed into the ground and a plug of soil is left in the muzzle, making the
weapon useless until cleared out. This can also scratch the lens and
reduce the effectiveness of the weapon.

##### 4.3.3: Use of Your Weapon

When using a weapon there are a number of techniques that you can use to improve your
accuracy, and a number of practices that you must adopt to ensure that you and your
colleagues are not accidentally hurt by your weapon.

* At all times your weapon should be within arms reach. if not you are
risking having it stolen or if attacked you will have no means of attack or
defense, therefore will be unable to do your job.

* When handling weapons your trigger finger should be outside the trigger
guard, unless you actually intend to fire. If not an accidental trip, or
stumble can cause you to pull the trigger and possible cause casualties to
your colleagues or even your self.

* At no time should you negligently discharge you weapon. That is to fire at
nothing, as this could cause unintended casualties, and/or cause your unit
to assume they are coming under enemy fire.

* When moving around carrying your weapon in your hands, you must be
acutely aware of where the muzzle is pointing. The practice of waving your
weapon around having the muzzle pointing at you colleagues is known as
“muzzle sweeping’, and should not occur. When moving you weapon
around, keep its muzzle pointing to the ground, the sky or into areas
where nopody is.

* When shooting your weapon, especially in built up areas, you must be
aware that IR weapons can and do reflect of white and or shiny surfaces,
the beam can bounce back and strike you or your colleagues.

* When shooting you should squeeze the trigger, not pull or snap it, as
pulling or snapping causes the weapon to pull to the side slightly, which
can be enough miss.

* When shooting you should make sure you are as stable as possible, as
this cuts down on weapon shake and improves your accuracy. The most
stable position is lying down. This is not always advisable or possibile
however, so you shouid use every opportunity to steady your weapon,
such as when standing by trees use it to lean yourself and the weapon
against, walls, vehicles etc. can all be used and should whenever practi-
cal.

* When shooting at an enemy it is vital to actually take aim on the target,
snap shooting and shooting from the hip is a waste of time. Most
weapons come with some sort of aiming device, normal an iron sight or
some sort of telescopic sight. You must be aware of how to use the sight
on your weapon.

*8* Before shooting at an enemy target you should ensure that your weapon
has the range to hit the target. The only real way to do this is to practice
on ranges and learn what the effective range of your weapon looks like on
the ground.

### 4.4: Target Indication

When you are on a mission you may be the only marine in your squad to see something
that others need to be aware of. It could be where a sniper is hidden or a civilian is sitting
down etc. Whatever it is you need a method of showing other marines in your squad
where to look.

The method that is used the clock method.

##### 4.4.1: Axis of Advance

Whatever way your Squad is moving is known as the AXIS of advance. It should be made
clear here that it is the direction the squad is moving, not the direction that each individual
is facing that is the Axis of Advance. The axis of advance is known as 12 O'clock. the
direction the squad has come from is 6 O'clock.

lf a squad is stationary the squad commander will have nominated an axis of advance.

##### 4.4.2: Range - Indication - Target

When you want to guide someone on to the thing you have seen there are three pieces of
information that you should give:-

- Range - In meters as near as you can estimate it to.
- Indication - This is the clock position of what ever you have seen.
- Target - What have you seen and any other details that will help in locating
what ever you have seen.

Below are some examples of target indication:

_“30 meters - 3 O'clock - 2 bandits”_

The extra details could include :-

_“30 meters - 3 O'clock - 2 bandits Low”_

The "low" would indicate that the two bandits lying down, in a ditch, etc. If you said “high”
the bandits would be up a tree , on top of a wall etc.

_“30 meters - 3 O'clock - 2 bandits moving left to right”_

Left to right or right to left would indicate the direction the bandits would be moving.

##### 4.4.3: Hand Signals for Target Indication

When trying to give target indication silently there are two hand signals that are used.
The first is to literaily point to the target.

The second is to give a range by holding up one hand and using one finger per ten meters
of range to the target, so you have a range of 10 to 50 meters. Any further than 50 meters
and you will be able to talk.

### 4.5: Unit Formations

##### 4.5.1: Introduction

The formations listed below can all be performed by squads, but some of them are un-
suitable for smaller units and bigger units. The commander of a unit or a point man would |
decide the formation to be used depending on the terrain, mission order, unit size etc. As a
marine you must know all the formations so when ordered into a formation you can instant-
ly go into the formation, in the right place, with the right spacing, knowing your sectors of
observation and stay with your buddy and fire team.

When in formation the spacing of the unit will depend on the terrain and light conditions. In
general the spacing during daylight on reasonable open terrain should be in the region of
five to ten meters (5-10m) and at night three to six meters(3-6m). At all times the spacing
between marines should be irregular as regular patterns are not natural and will draw the
eye of an observer.

The point man’s sector of observation wouid be directly in front and the rear man’s directly
behind him. When every one in unit has been given their sector to watch there should be
360° coverage. Once given your sector to watch, this does not mean that it is the only direction
you watch, it is the area you watch mostly, but keep looking around to see hand signals
and you may see something in someone's sector that they missed.

When moving all marines should stay quiet unless there is a need to talk, and concentrate
on staying alert and watchful.

##### 4.5.2: Formation Orders

Formation orders are hand signals that are used in any formation to direct control the
formation as well as pass information through the formation to the marines that need to
know, usually the NCO's and officers.

Hand signals should be given slowly and clearly, not rushed. Also exaggerate the move-
ment so at distance it is possible to make out the signal.

###### 4.5.2.1: Commanding Officer (CO)

The hand signal for CO is tapping your shoulder. It can be the CO of anything from a fire
a upwards, in the case of fire teams prefixed by the hand signal of the team the CO
belongs to.

###### 4.5.2.2: 2nd in Command (2iC)

The hand signal for 2iC is tapping your upper arm. It can be the 2iC of anything from a
Brick upwards, in the case of Bricks being prefixed by the hand signal of the team the 2iC
belongs to.

###### 4.5.2.3: Tack Team

The hand signal for the “Tack Team" is a clenched fist raised above the head. This hand
signal is only used for inter-squad communication.

###### 4.5.2.4: Fire Team

The hand signal for the "Fire Team" is the hand formed into a pistol shape raised above the
head. This hand signal is only good for inter-squad communication.

###### 4.5.2.5: Listen

Listen means just listen, often pointing is used with it to show which
direction to listen in.

The hand signal for Listen is one hand cupped around an ear.

###### 4.5.2.6: Repeat

Repeat means repeat the last message sent by hand signal, often be-
cause the beginning was missed or the hand signals were not clear
enough.

The hand signal for Repeat is both hands cupped around the ears.

###### 4.5.2.7: Observe

Observe means look, usually used with pointing to show what direction to look in.

The hand signal for Observe is to place one hand over the top the eyes, as if shading your
eyes from the sun.

###### 4.5.2.8: Yes

The hand signa! for Yes is to slowly and with exaggeration nod your head.

###### 4.5.2.9: No

The hand signal for No is to slowly and with exaggeration shake your head.

###### 4.5.2.10: OK

This can be a question or an answer depending on the context that it is used in.

The hand signal! for OK is the thumb and fore finger of one hand formed into an “O”
shape.

###### 4.5.2.11: On Me

This is used to call individuals to you, usually CO's and 2iC’s of units (see
hand signals for CO/2iC/Tack team/Fire Team). If it is not prefixed with the
signal for one of the above it will mean everyone in the unit.

The hand signal for On Me is to place a cupped hand on top of the head.

###### 4,5.2.12: Close Up / Space out

When moving in formation the spacing between
marines will vary, changing all the time. Often the
spacing will get too close and sometimes too great. “ Bs
lf you feel someone is too close or far away
you give this hand signal too get the spacing right,
or react accordingly if some one else is giving you
the hand signal.

The hand signal for Close Up is with a straight hand and arm pointing downward, palm
facing forwards, make short, sharp, repeated movements forwards.

The hand signal for Space Out is with a straight hand and arm pointing downward, palm
facing backwards, make short, sharp, repeated movements backwards.

###### 4.5.2.13: Go Faster

The hand signal for Go Faster is make the hand into a fist and put the
arm out to the side, but not straight and shake the fist up and down. The
faster and more emphasis the fist is given the
faster it means you should go.

###### 4.5.2.14: Slow Down

This command is usually given by the CO or a point man. The hand
signal for Slow Down is to put your arm out and down with a straight
hand and slowly wave the arm and hand up and down. The slower this
is done the slower you should go.

###### 4.5.2.15: Lie Down

This command is usually given by the CO or the point man. The hand
signal for Lie Down is the hand straight and palm down slowly push
down towards the ground repeatedly.

###### 4.5.2.16: Freeze

This command is given by any one, usually when they think they have seen the enemy but
think vite and the rest of the unit has not yet been seen, or if the presence of APD’s is
suspected.

The command Freeze means literally that - do not move at all until the signal for Carry On
IS given (see below). The only allowable movement is if caught mid-step, to slowly lower
the raised foot to the ground.

There are two hand signals for Freeze, the first is for
normal use and is to put your arm up in the air with a
straight hand paim facing forwards. This is highly
visibie and with a good well switched on unit will
immediately have the desired response. If you need to
call the Freeze without out being quite so visible the
hand signal is to put your arm straight down palm
facing backwards.

###### 4.5.2.17: Carry On

This command is usually given by the CO or the point man or the marine
who called a freeze after what ever has caused the formation to stop
doing whatever it was has been resolved.

The hand signal for Carry On is put the arm straight out from the shoulder
with the arm bent at the elbow. Then gently wave the lower arm from side
to side.

###### 4.5.2.18: Emergency Rendezvous (ERV)

This command is used first by the point man, then by every marine as he passes the same
spot as the point man did wnen he gave this signai. This signal indicates exactly where the
ERV is to be.

An ERV is a designated meeting point for ail members of a unit to meet up again, if some-
thing goes wrong and the unit gets badly split up and needs to reorganize. Every time a
new ERV is set the last ERV ceases to exist. There can only be ONE ERV at any time. If
the ERV is being used the first marines there should set up a perimeter and ‘use the
password and challenge as other members of the unit come to the ERV. As the unit re-
groups the senior marine should organize the marines into All Round Defense. Stay in this
formation till the CO arrives and takes over or the most senior marine gives up hope of the
CO rejoining the unit and takes command.

The hand signal for ERV is with the index finger pointing downward
draw a circle then punch down with the finger at the precise location of
the ERV. Make sure the marine behind acknowledges the signal, so he
can pass it on behind him.

###### 4.5.2.19: Enemy Ambush Seen or Suspected

This hand signal is usually used by the point man to warn his CO and the rest of the unit
that he thinks there may be an ambush, or an area he feels is a high risk area.

The hand signal for Ambush Seen or Suspected is to place a open hand to the face, palm
facing the face to make a sort of mask.

###### 4.5.2.20: Enemy Seen or Suspected

This hand signal is usually used by the point man to warn his CO and
the rest of the unit that ne thinks he has seen some enemy forces.

The hand signal for Enemy Seen or Suspected is to make a fist with the
thumb sticking out, downward.

###### 4.5.2.21: No Enemy Seen or Suspected

This hand signal would be used by a point man or a scout a little way
ahead of the unit to show that he thinks the area is clear of enemy.

The hand signal for No Enemy Seen or Suspected is to make a fist with
the thumb sticking out, upwards.

It must be emphasized the last three hand signals are not stating facts, just what
the man making the signai thinks to be the case.

###### 4.5.2.22: Extended Line

Extended line is normally used for wood clearance or a frontal
assault. It has superb fire power to the front and rear,but virtually
none to the sides. This formation should be used with
care as the unit is fairly inflexible and exposed to flank attacks.

The hand signal for extended line is for both arms extended
straight out from the shoulders horizontally.

The diagram below shows the layout of this formation:

![Extended Line Formation](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_extended-line.png "Extended Line Formation")

Numbers 1/2/7/8 should not be the unit CO, radio man, 2iC, medic or unit heavy weapon.
The order that these personal are listed in is also the order of priority to keep away from
the flank positions. With an eight man Squad or just a Brick it would not be possible to
keep all the personnel listed above away from the flanks, so follow the priority order.

###### 4.5.2.23: File Single

Single file is not ideal for large formation as the length of the file makes
the unit very unwieldy and communication between point and tail very
slow and difficult. This formation is used for moving fast or in dense
terrain, especially at night where an attack would be expected to the
flanks of the unit. The fire power of this formation is excellent to the left
and right but very poor to the front and rear.

The hand signal for single file is one arm raised straight above the head, fingers straight
and palm facing the head.

The diagram beiow shows the layout of this formation:

![Single File Formation](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_single-file.png "Single File Formation")

Numbers 1/2/7/8 should not be the unit CO, radio man, 2iC, medic or unit heavy weapon.
The order that these persona! are listed in is also the order of priority to keep away from
the point andrear positions.With an eight man Squad or just a Brick it would not be poss-
ible to keep all the personal listed above away from the flanks, so follow the priority order.

###### 4.5.2.24: File Extended

Staggered or double file is useful to all unit sizes with good firepower to
the flanks and reasonabie firepower to the point and rear. This formation
is often used for a unit that wishes to move at a reasonabie speed while
retaining some tactical control and advantage.

The hand signal for staggered file is one arm raised straight above the
head, the other arm also raised above the head but lower than the first
arm. The fingers on both arms straight with palms facing the head.

The diagram below shows the layout of the formation.

![Double File Formation](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_double-file.png "Double File Formation")

Numbers 1/5/4/8 should not be the unit CO, radio man, 2iC, medic or unit heavy weapon.
The order that these personal are listed in is also the order of priority to keep away from
the point and rear positions.With an eight man Squad or just a Brick it would not be poss-
ible to keep all the personal listed above away from the point or rear, so follow the order of
priority.

###### 4.5.2.25: Arrow

Arrow formation is of no use to Bricks and of limited use to squads and
more the useful to larger unit sizes. Arrow nas reasonabie firepower to
the flanks and reasonable firepower tothe point and rear. This formation
is often used for a unit that wishes to move at a reasonable speed while
retaining tactical control and advantage. Arrow is used when a unit is not
sure where an aitack would come from.

The hand signal for arrow is both arms straight angled down and behind the body. The
fingers on both arms straight with palms facing away the body.

The diagram below shows the layout of the formation

![Arrow Formation](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_arrow-formation.png "Arrow Formation")

Numbers 1/6/7 should not be the unit CO, radio man, 2iC, medic or unit heavy weapon.
The order that these personal are listed in is aiso the order of priority to keep away from
the point and rear positions.With an eight man squad it would not be possible to keep all
the personal listed above away from the front and rear, so foliow the order of priority.

Number 8 is the unit CO, or in larger units the HQ squad

###### 4.5.2.26: All Around Defense (ARD)

ARD is the useful to all unit sizes with good firepower in all directions. ARD is the only
formation that is stationary at all times. ARD is used when a unit is trying to reorganize
after action, when on the move and the CO needs to stop to organize something or talk to
a member of the unit.

The hand signal for All Round Defense is with just the index finger pointing up making a
circular motion around the head.

The diagram below shows the layout of the formation.

![All Round Defense Formation](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_all-round-defense.png "All Round Defense Formation")

All marines should where possible be in cover when in this formation.

At night the spacing of this formation is closer than any other, the shape is the same, but
each marines right leg will be over the left leg of the marine to the right of him. This ts to
stop infiltration of the unit and so messages can be quietly passed around the unit by
tapping the person to the left or right of you with your leg.

Y is where the CO can go and call people into his position.

### 4.6: Immediate Action Drills (IAD’s)

##### 4.6.1: Introduction

Immediate action drills (IAD’s) are set pieces that you as a marine should carry out when a
certain set of circumstances occur. As the name suggest these are actions that should be
carried out instantly, with the CO often not needing to give any orders. Often your and your
units survival will depend on you and your fellow marines carry out the IAD’s quickly and
properly.

##### 4.6.2: Contact

When you come under effective, or what you believe to be effective enemy fire for the first
time you call out “CONTACT”, as loudly as necessary for all members of your unit to hear.

What is meant by effective enemy fire is:-

1. You can actually see the enemy troops taking aim and FIRING at you.
2. You cannot see the enemy but your screen has registered a hit.
3. You cannot see the enemy, your screen has not registered a hit but you
can hear enemy fire close by.

In case three you must be in mind if the enemy was in fact not firing at you when you
called contact he will when you nave finished calling the contact, so be sure that the fire is
coming your way.

##### 4.6.3: DDCOF

DDCOF is an acronym for what happens when you or another member of your unit calls a
“contact”, you should do this drill when ever you come under effective fire, unless it is an
ambush, for which there is another drill (see section 4.6.4 below).

DDCOF stands for :-

* Dash
* Dive
* Crawl
* Observe
* Fire

The dash, dive, crawl should all be in different directions to each other, and to the direction
you were taking when the contact occurred. Each stage should be in the region of three to
five meters, and at the end of the crawl you should be in cover.

The observe stands for finding out where the enemy fire is coming from, by looking for the
enemy and listening to the target indication given by the marine who saw the enemy. If you
are the only member of the unit who saw where the fire was coming from you must give
the target indication so the other members of your unit can find the enemy.

Fire is just that, opening up on the enemy, uniess you have specific mission orders not to
fire or your CO cails a cease fire.

##### 4.6.4: Counter Ambush

Counter Ambush is the drill you should go into when you are ambushed at relatively close
range, at longer range DDCOF Is probably of more use. This Drill is not full proof but it
offers a reasonable chance of survival if the entire units acts together, as soon as the
ambush has been sprung. Delays in effecting the counter ambush will cost you and your
unit dear.

The drill is to charge the enemy unit that has ambushed you. The reason for this Is, if itis a
weil set ambush, directiy in front of the ambushers will be either impeneirabie terrain or it
will be mined, so moving in this direction is pointless. If the ambushed unit kept going in the
same direction as before the ambush it allows the ambushers longer to fire, while the
ambushedunit cannot fire, turning back the way the ambushed unit has just come has the
same problems as carrying on. While charging the unit should fire, and once through the
enemy unit keep going for at least twenty meters, before going to cover in ARD.

Once the CO has reorganized someone goes back to check on the enemy and marine
casualties.

If the enemy has set an L or Z ambush (see section 4.9 - Ambushes) you must keep
charging the enemy till you are clear.

##### 4.6.5: Hasty Ambush

Hasty ambush is an IAD that is usually called by the point man or rear man. It is called
when the point man has seen an enemy or suspected enemy unit heading towards his unit,
but he thinks the enemy has not yet seen him or his unit.

The hand signal for Hasty Ambush is the hand in a fist, repeatedly punched out to the side.

With this formation signal, whether the left or right arm is used is relevant. If the right arm is
used the unit moves to the right of the track/road etc. that is being moved along and goes
into cover facing the way they have just moved from, forming an | ambush (see section
4.9.2 below). If the left arm is used then the unit does the same except to the left.

A hasty ambush once set should only be initiated by the unit CO or any member of the unit
who is absolutely sure that he has been seen. Once firing has started all members of the
unit should open fire immediately.

### 4.7: Personal Movement

##### 4.7.1: Introduction

When moving as an individual or as a unit, the faster you want to move the more noise you
will make and the more likely to be spotted, conversely the slower you can move, with
more care the less noise will be made, and you will be less likely to be spotted. There are a

number of guide lines that you should follow, these are listed below as are the methods of
moving in a combat area.

##### 4.7.2: Guide to Moving

When moving you should always be looking for your next piece of cover, so if you come
under fire you have somewhere to go to immediately.

##### 4.7.3: Moving in a Combat Area

###### 4.7.3.1: Daylight Walking

When walking during the day, you should be able to see any obstructions in your way or
litter that will make noise as you walk over it. The quieter you wish to be the more care
you should to take to avoid walking on materials that will make noise.

Sometimes it is unavoidabie, so to cut the noise lift your feet clear of obstacles and when
lowering you feet put your foot down evenly, not toe or heel first, so as to keep the
ground pressure as low as possible. Make sure your strides are smali enough that if you
decide or need to put the raised foot somewhere else to what you first thought you are
not so unbalanced that it has to go down where you first intended.

###### 4.7.3.2: Crouch

When moving at a crouch, normally past low walls or hedges, or in ditches, keep you
head up and watch that you posture does not rise to walk with just your head bowed.

###### 4.7.3.3: Ghost Walk

At night this is a method of moving quietly the more care that is taken the quieter it will
be but at the cost of time.

The method is to lift your feet right up high, so as to ensure you clear all obstacles, lower
your feet gently and evenly to keep ground pressure low. At the same time your hands
should be moving around in front of you, from ground level to the top of your head so as
to ensure you do not walk into any thing and cause noise, such things as branches or
trip-wires (whether mined or not) being examples.

###### 4.7.3.4: High Crawl

This crawl is not a very quiet but is fast is you need to stay low but noise is not a con-
cern. It can if down slowly be fairly quiet thougn.

The way to do this crawl is crawling on your hands and knees, taking care not to ground
your weapon and keeping your head up so you can see around you.

###### 4.7.3.5: Low Crawl

This crawl can be used for moving fast or for moving quietly depending on the mission
requirements. It allows you to move keeping the lowest silhouette possible, ideal if you
need to move in long grass, depressions in the ground or ridges on the ground.

The way to do this crawl is to be lying on your stomach, cradling your weapon to avoid
grounding it, with your head raised so you can see where you are going. Then bring one
leg up till the knee is level with the stomach, the opposite arm bent so the hand is almost
touching the shoulder with the elbow in front of your head. You then lift your body of the
ground,straighten the leg and tuck the elbow back into the body, while not moving the
foot or elbow. Repeat this with the opposite leg and arm.

This crawl can be very tiring so insure the legs do most of the work and your back hind
does not rise up. The faster you wish to craw! the noise you will make, if a reasonable
amount of quietness is needed clear the ground ahead of you. if near silence is needed
use the “Stealth Craw”.

###### 4.7.3.6: Stealth Crawi

This crawl is incredibly slow and of no use if time is short, however if you have the time
this crawl is virtually silent, and can be used to move across fairly open pieces of ground
with a much reduced chance of being seen.

The way to do this crawl is lie on your stomach, cradling your weapon to avoid grounding
it, with your legs straight and your arms tucked into your body with the hands around
head level with your head down. Bring your toes up to as close to your knees as they will
go, then using your toes and elbows raise your body of the ground and rock forward and
gently and evenly lower your body back to the ground.

What can make this crawi so silent is after each move forward clear the ground ahead of
you of all debris that will make any noise as your weight comes to rest on it. Do this slowly
and gently placing the debris to the side of you.

Other than the slowness of this crawl the other big disadvantage Is as you are moving you
are unable to see what is happening around you, to combat this keep your ears open and
every now and again stop the craw and slowly raise your head to look around, this should
enable you not to be surprised by the enemy but also keeps you on line for your objective.

### 4.8: Camouflage & Concealment

##### 4.8.1: introduction

When on operations, it is vital that as well as moving as quietly as possible to avoid
detection, you also do not stand out against the surroundings. If possible, you should
actually try to blend in, so that you can hardly, and if possibly not at all, be seen.

##### 4.8.2: Cover vs Concealment

Concealment is something that hides you from the enemy, but does not protect you from
incoming fire if the enemy has already seen you, or from speculative fire. An example of
concealment is light bush.

Cover is something that hides you from the enemy and protects you from incoming fire.
An example of cover is a brick wall.

From the descriptions above, it should be obvious that cover is always preferred to con-
cealment, if you are trying to avoid being seen and hit. Unfortunately, cover tends to be
difficult to move around, and if you could the enemy would be able to see you coming.
Concealment however, is possible to move around using Camouflage. It is important to
remember Camouflage reduces the chances of being seen, NOT of being hit if fired upon.

##### 4.8.3: Cover and Concealment on the Move

When you are moving you should keep looking for your next piece of cover or conceal-
ment. Where you will go if you suddenly come under fire. The location you decide on will
have to constantly change as you move as the piece of cover or concealment you had
decided on becomes too far away to be of any use if you were fired on.

You should whenever possible avoid using what is known as “isolated cover’. An example
of this would be a tree in the middle of a field. The problem with this sort of cover or
concealment is that once you are there, the enemy knows where you are and you cannot
move without becoming a target. If it is the ONLY piece of cover or concealment you may
use it, but try whenever possible not to.

##### 4.8.3: The Seven “S”s of Camouflage

###### 4.8.3.1: Shape

The human eye and brain, when looking around, looks for familiar shapes to identify
things. In the case of humans, the is searching for the head, shoulders, arms and legs,
the head and shoulder shape being the most distinctive. So if this shape is disguised and
someone is looking for humans, then if they DO see you, your shape does not register as
human, and so you are ignored. ,

To achieve this effect, something like scrim net draped from the head to the shoulders will
break the shape up. Foliage attached to the arms and legs will break up their shape
similarly. Just wearing fairly baggy combats can have this effect.

lf you are carrying a long arm, the straight unnatural shape should be broken by wrapping
scrim netting around its length, ensuring that it does not affect the operation of the
weapon.

When breaking up shape in this way, do not go to extremes otherwise you will show up as
unnatural and the camouflage could also impair your ability to move at speed if neces-
sary.

###### 4.8.3.2: Surface

If you are moving through a built up area and are covered in foliage, your surface does
not match the surroundings and you will show up. If in a deciduous wood with evergreen
foliage on your surface, again you will not match. Try to keep yourself looking like the
surroundings, even if this means changing foliage frequently.

###### 4.8.3.3: Shine

Any kind of shine can give away your position, day or night. There are a number of
causes for this, including glasses, binos, sweat, bare flesh and torches.

For glasses and binos, all you can do is take care that they are not aliowed to reflect
sunlight.

Try not to sweat too much, and remove any sweat you can without destroying other
camouflage you are using.

Bare flesh is dealt with by using camo- cream. This is liberally spread on the exposed
flesh, normally the face, neck, hands wrists and eyes (including inside). If possible you
should use 2 or 3 colours. Use darker colours on the lighter areas i.e. cheek bones, nose
and forehead, and lighter colours on the darker areas i.e. the eye sockets, and under the
chin. Use an irregular pattern to break up the Shape of the face.

lf cammo- cream is unavailable, you can use mud, ash, soot (from burnt cork), but these
methods will need to be frequently renewed.

On a mission, you should be aware that the use of torches, especially at night, can give
your position away to enemy troops a long way from your position - so the use of torches,
even if used with a red light filter, should be kept to a minimum.

###### 4.8.3.4: Sound

Before going out on an operation, ensure that you and your kit are making no unneces-
Sary noise, rattles, squeaks, etc. When actually out, you should only talk if absolutely
necessary, and then keep the volume as low as possible. Radio squeiches should be as
high as possible and the volumes as low as possible, even if you are using an ear-piece.

When actually moving, you should move as slowly as possible and watch where you put
your feet and be aware of the noise you can generate brushing past obstructions.

###### 4.8.3.5: Shadow

When moving, you should try to stay in the shadows, as this makes you harder to see. If
there are no real shadows, then avoid the brightly lit areas.

You should at all times be aware of the shadow you are casting, as this can very easily
give your position away.

###### 4.8.3.6: Silhouette

Even if you follow alli the rules of camouflage, you will be easily seen if you then skyline
yourself. A moving silhouette is very quickly seen. There are a number of ways you can
skyline yourself, so you should be aware of them and avoid skylining.

The most common way is to come over the crest of a hill. This is easily avoided by com-
ing round a hill rather than over. If you have to come over the crest, cross the crest as low
as possible.

When crossing obstacles (e.g. fences), try to go around them. If you cant, then stay as
low as possible while going over.

Standing close to windows or door also skylines you. If you are looking out of a window or
door stand back, away from it.

In woody areas, crossing paths will often skyline you. Standing next to a tree but away
from it will also skyline you, so stand right next to the tree - you should appear to be part
of the tree then.

###### 4.8.3.7: Spacing

In nature, there is very iittie that is regular, so a unit of men evenly spaced out will show
up to an observer as odd, and could lead to your presence being detected. To avoid this,
keep your spacing between men irregular.

##### 4.8.4: Movement

The section on Personal Movement (section 4.7 above) covers how you should move to
keep as quiet as possible, but as well as this you should move irregularly. In nature, very
little moves rhythmically, and to do so is to draw attention to yourself.

##### 4.8.5: Summary

To remain unseen in the battlefield will take constant awareness and attention to detail. If
you are in a stationary position, you can afford to camouflage yourself to fit perfectly in

with the surroundings. If you are on the move, you will have to compromise between
camouflage and your ability to do the mission in the allotted time and with success.

### 4.9: Ambushes

##### 4.9.1: Introduction

When laying an ambush, the more time and care that is taken in setting it up the less likely
it is to be seen prematurely and the more likely it is to succeed, even against well trained
experienced troops.

Once an ambush has been set you MUST NOT open fire until either the CO opens up or
you are absolutely certain that your presence has been detected. If some one other than
the CO opens up because their nerve failed or they were sure they had been seen you
should immediately open fire.

The three examples below are ideal ambushes, assuming enough troops to set them up
and plenty of time to arrange everything. This rarely happens but the more features of
each ambush you can

include the more likely the ambush is to succeed. A fourth ambush, “Hasty Ambush” by its
very nature is not ideal and is detailed in the section on IAD’s (section 4.6.5 above).

##### 4.9.2: The ‘T' Ambush

The T ambush is the simplest of the set ambushes,(Hasty Ambush is simpler - see section
4.6.5 above), but if set well can still be a devastating ambush.

Below is a diagram of how the T ambush should be set up.

![T Ambush Structure](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_t-ambush.png "T Ambush Structure")

Y1 to Y3 are used to ensure that the main part of the unit, X, cannot be ambushed them-
selves and in the case of Y1, to alert X when the enemy unit is close. All the Y’s can also
act as sweeper units to pick off men from the enemy unit that escape the main ambush.

Y3 should be well enough placed so if the ambushed unit breaks though, the enemy will
not discover them and if X continues to fire at the enemy unit once it has broken though
they will not be hit by friendly fire.

The * area should either be very rough or virtually impenetrable terrain, if this is not poss-
ible you should mine the area. All units should be well camouflaged, with clear lanes of
fires, and routes of escape, so if the ambush goes wrong everyone has a chance to get
away.

##### 4.9.3: The ‘L’ Ambush

The ‘L’ ambush requires more men to set up properly but is a much more effective
ambush and can deal with larger enemy forces and better trained units. Against very ill-
trained forces however it may not be so effective as they will often not go into the anti-
ambush drill (see section 4.6.4 above) and so will not run into the killing area of the leg of
the L.

![L Ambush Structure](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_l-ambush.png "L Ambush Structure")

Y1 to Y3 are used to ensure that the main part of the unit, X, cannot be ambushed them-
selves and in the case of Y1, to alert X when the enemy unit is close. All the Y’s can also
act as sweeper units to pick off men from the enemy unit that escape the main ambush.

Y2-Y3 should take care of their positions because of the possibilities of friendly fire coming
their way in this ambush.

##### 4.9.4: The ‘Z’ Ambush

Th ‘Z’ ambush needs a large force of men to accomplish probably at least a full strength
platoon. If a “Z’ ambush is successfully carried out can be an absolutely devastating
ambush and could take a much larger force than the ambushers. As for the ‘L’ ambush tt
has limited value against poorly trained troops.

![Z Ambush Structure](/content/in-character/marines-handbook/marines-handbook_basic-combat-training_z-ambush.png "Z Ambush Structure")

Y1 to Y4 are used to ensure that the main part of the unit, X, cannot be ambushed them-
selves and in the case of Y1, to alert X when the enemy unit is close. All the Y’s can also
act as sweeper units to pick off men from the enemy unit that escape the main ambush.

##### 4.10: Security

###### 4.10.1: Passwords and Challenges

Passwords are used so you can identify your own troops if you either don't know them
personally or light conditions make visual identification impossible. DO NOT rely on the
voice sounding like someone you know. In most cases the use of passwords and challen-
ges are enough to identify someone as a friend or enemy.

When you see or hear someone(s) approaching who you do not recognize as friendly call
out,

_“Halt Colonial Marines!”_

Call out clearly and just loudly enough to be clearly heard while staying in cover yourself.
they do not stop call out again a little louder, if they still do not stop, open fire.

lf they stop call out, keeping your voice to the minimum,

_“Who goes there ?”_

They shouid reply in a similarly low voice telling you who they are. You then cail out,

_"Advance one to be recognized.”_

lf there are more than one, only one should advance, the others staying still. If more than
one start moving call “Halt!“ again, and if they keep moving as a group, open fire.

The one man advancing should be holding his weapon in a non-threatening way. Halt the
advancing man 2 to 3 meters in front of you and issue the challenge. You should do this in
a very low voice so no one else can overhear.

If the reply is not the current password disarm and place under guard.

If there is more than one, once the first man has correctly returned the password get him
to go into cover close to your position and call out,

_“Advance one to be recognized.”_

Make sure the first man in identifies each man as he comes in as a member of his team,
also ensure he teils you when the last man has passed though your position.

There are two main types of challenge and password in use within the CMC.

The first is the random word challenge. ie. _“Beans”_ to which the password is _“Coffee”_.

The second method is to have a number, usually below 20 and above 10. The challenge
is any number below the chosen number. The password Is then a number when added to
the challenge totals up to the chosen number. For example:

Chosen number _15_. Challenge _10_. Password _5_. i.e. _10+5 = 15_.

##### 4.11: Fire and Movement

Fire and movement is a technique that if done correctly enables troops to move up to
enemy positions while under fire and sustain minimal casualties, it can also be used to
retreat from an enemy force that is to large to attack and while sustaining reasonable
casualties without a rout starting. It can also be used for moving through areas that are
believed to have a high than normal risk of ambush, except there is no firing till an enemy
ambush is discovered, it also can be done at a normal speed as opposed to at a run
when under fire.

To explain the working of Fire and Movement in the explanation below a squad of eight
men with two Bricks, Tack Team and Fire Team will be used. The principle for units
smaller or larger ts still valid. )

Assuming the squad has come under fire at long range and the squad is all down in cover
returning fire and the CO calls:

_‘Movement by Fire and Movement. Tack Team/Fire Team Ready?”_

He would be asking his 2ic who should be in charge of the other Brick. When the 2ic is
ready he should call:

_“Ready.”_

The CO then calls for which ever team he has decided to move first to move:

_“Tack Team/Fire Team GO GO GO.”_

The nominated Brick snouid then ieap to there feet and charge towards the enemy iook-
ing for a piece of cover 3 -5 meters away from there start position, when they get there go
to cover. While they are charging the other Brick is laying constant fire into the enemy
position to keep his head down and his aim off the moving Brick. When charging, the
moving Brick must be careful not to cross the arcs of fire of the firing Brick, as this will
either cause a self inflicted hit or stop the firing Brick from giving covering fire, and often
both.

As soon as the CO of the moving Brick knows all his men are down he should call

_“Ready.”_

His Brick then lays down covering fire and the CO of the Brick that previously laying down
covering fire shouid call:

_“Fire/Tack team GO GO GO.”_

The Brick then leaps to its feet and charges looking for cover 3-5 meters ahead.

The entire procedure is repeated till the unit is 10 - 20 meters from the enemy position
when the entire squad should charge the enemy.

A number of rules should be emphasized:-

* Do not cross arcs of fire.
* All orders should be loud and clear (unless not under fire).
* The time lag between one Brick going down to cover and the next getting
up should be the minimum possible.
* At No time should more than haif the unit/units involved be moving, more
can be firing, but not moving.

### 6: Assessed Written Test and Practical Assessment

Following instructional sessions, the recruit is required to take and pass both a written
examination. and an assessment of his practical performance during training before he or
she is inducted into the Colonial Marine Corps.
