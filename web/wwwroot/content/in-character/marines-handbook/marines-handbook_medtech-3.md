### 1: Introduction

The following document forms the course notes for those taking the CMC Med-Tech level
3 course No.CMC95/1M0102, and as such is required reading for that course.

Evaluation of this course is by a supervised written examination.

##### 1.1: Course Prerequisites

Any one taking this course must have already successfully completed Med-Tech 4. These
notes are intended for those taking the Med-Tech Grade 3 course and should be read in
conjunction with those for Med-Tech Grade 4 (CMC/1M0101).

### 2: Course Description

### 4:Course Notes

##### 4.1: Treating Incapacitating Radiation

As a Med-tech Grade 3 you are able to deal with casualties from IR with all the blue and
green dots removed from their IR monitoring cards, but who still have yellow dots on their
monitoring cards. If they have only amber or red dots left you will need a higher grade
Med-Tech to deal with the patient.

The procedure is identical as for a Med-Tech 4. However when the patient comes round
they will still need looking after as disorientation, nausea and blurred vision will occur and
may persist for a short while.

lf the symptoms are severe you may need to piace them in the recovery position and
treat them for shock (see 4.5 and 4.8) for as long as the symptoms persist.

Note: You must still remove the top dot from the IR monitoring card and return the card.

##### 4.2: Incapacitating Radiation

When personal are hit by Incapacitating Radiation (IR), whether shielded or not, the IR
causes an electrical storm in the brain. To protect its self the brain releases a chemical,
Diazatrophin, to block the nerve ends and prevent further damage and stimulation. The
larger the dose of IR the larger the electrical storm and the more Diazatrophin is
released. Eventually there is so much Diazatrophin in the brain that all messages to and
from the brain are stopped and coma followed by death occurs.

At the same time as producing Diazatrophin, the brain also produces a second drug
known as Banatrophin, that breaks down the Diazatrophin over a period of time, freeing
the nerve ends up.

The resus drugs Garatin, Hydratil and Defalacil act by causing the brain to release
Banatrophin in much larger quantities and much faster, hence allowing very fast recovery
from dangerous doses of IR. Under certain circumstances you will be unabie to treat a
patient with the 3 resus drugs, i.e: there are none left, time does not allow it within the 1/2
hour, or the patient is allergic to those drugs. To allow you to deal with this situation a
drug known as Diazamorphite has been developed.

Diazamorphite works by imitating the bodies natural drug Diazatrophin. In that it blocks all
the nerve ends and stops Diazatrophin blocking the nerve ends. Like Diazatrophin it
blocks messages to and from the brain. It does however allow a small amount of electri-
cal impulses through and that is enough to allow the body to continue to function.

Diazamorphite is unaffected by Banatrophin, so further medical treatment is necessary
within 24 hours to prevent the patient dying. It is important to note 2 doses of
Diazamorpnhite will cause almost immediate death as ail the nerve endings have doubie
the dose of the drug and this is enough to completely stop messages getting between the
brain and the rest of the body. It also in large quantities has a toxic effect on the body.

##### 4.3: Administration

Every time you treat a patient you must keep accurate records of what is wrong with the
patient and what action you take. As a Med- Tech 3 you will have a number of procedures
and drugs that you are qualified to use, but records must be kept.

As a Med-Tech 3 there are a number of types of administration you must keep. They
must be as up to date as possible at all times.

- When issued with medical drugs and equipment you must sign for them. If
you give any of your drugs or equipment to another Med-Tech they must
sign for it.

- After you have resuscitated a patient you must record patients name, the IDP â€”
reading (see later) and the drugs you administered. This information
goes into the patient's Medical Log.

- When ever an overdose, deliberate or accidental occurs the Overdose
Report form and the patient's Medical Log must be filled in.

- When the Emergency Override Procedure is used, all the information on the
Overdose Form must be filled in, and the patient's Medical Log filled in.

- Negligent discharge of IR weapons is a disciplinary offense under CMC
regulations. If you witness an act of negligent discharge, you must report
it to the senior Med-Tech and the senior officer on duty in writing.

- After Diazamorphite is administered you must fill in a Diazamorphite Report
Form and fill in the patient's Medical Log.

- After the CIM Procedure has been done you must fill in the CIM Report Form,
Diazamorphite Report Form (if used), and the patient's Medical Log.

If you fail to keep your Administration in order you are liabie to have your Med-Tech
status revoked and may face further disciplinary action.

As a Med-Tech 3 you are prohibited from carrying or administering any drugs other than
those specifically mentioned in Med-tech 4 or listed below, unless given written permis-
sion by an officer or a Med-Tech 1.

##### 4.4: Administering Diazamorphite

Under certain circumstances you will be unable to treat a patient with the 3 resus drugs,
i.e: there are none left,time does not allow it within the 1/2 hour or the patient is allergic to
those drugs. To allow you to deal with this situation a drug known as Diazamorphite has
been developed.

One of the other benefits of Diazamorphite is the blocking of the nerve endings slows all
the bodies systems down - heartbeat,respiration, liver functions etc. So if you need to
slow the body down to give you time to deal with the problem or get a more qualified
medic to deai with the problem (eg. uncontrollable loss of blood, ingestion of a toxic
substance, etc) a dose of Diazamorphite will give you the necessary time.

Before administering Diazamorphite YOU MUST check the forehead for a cross. If a
cross is present you must not administer the Diazamorphite, as the patient has already
had a dose.

As soon as you have administered a dose of Diazamorphite YOU MUST mark the
forehead of the patient with a cross. Once the patient has had the Diazamorphite and had
his forehead marked , move the patient into the recovery position (see below). If it is
possible some one should remain with the patient until they are removed to a medical
facility.

Diazamorphite is currently available in two forms:
DIAZAMORPHITE (b) - Clear green liquid.
DIAZAMORPHITE (i) - Brown capsule.

No more than 1 dose should be administered in any one 24 hour period, even if the
patient had been resuscitated after the first dose.

As soon as possibile after administering Diazamorphite the Diazamorphite Report Form
and the patient's Medical Log must be filled in.

##### 4.5: Recovery Position

- Kneeling beside the patient ,tilt his head and lift the chin to open the airway.
Making sure both the legs are straight, place the arm nearest you out at
right angles to the body, elbows bent, with the palm of the hand upper-
most.

- Bring the far arm across the chest and hold the hand against the patient's
cheek, palm outwards. With your other hand, grasp the further thigh and
puli the knee up, Keeping the foot on the ground.

- Keeping the patients hand pressed against the cheek with one hand, pull him
towards you with the other leg.

- Tilt the head back to make sure the airway remains open. Adjust the hand if
necessary, so that the head is well supported. Adjust the uppermost leg
so that both the knee and the hip are at right-angles. Check the breathing
and pulse regularly.

Ensure that when you are putting a patient in the recovery position you do not roll them
onto an injury or something that will cause one.

##### 4.6: Corporal Integrity Maintenance (CIM)

The RVC-877 Unit is capable of checking and re-setting screens,and diagnosing the level
of IR that a patient has absorbed. It is not, however programmed to deal with any other
injuries the patient may have sustained, thus Med-Techs of grade 4 are merely tech-
nicians, and have no medical classification.

At Grade 3 however, Med-Techs will be responsible for treating physical wounds, ie.
breaches of corporal integrity. The causes could be many and varied, but the standard
procedure remains the same.

###### 4.6.1: Corporal Integrity Maintenance Procedure

- If the patient is suffering from uncontrollable and massive blood loss then
administer a dose of Diazamorphite if possible.

- Remove any clothing from affected area (cut off if necessary).

- Diagnose cause of injury.

- Spray affected area(s) with Anti-biot.

- Spray affected area(s) with Synthiskin if wound is small enoughor cover with
a dressing.

- If the patient has suffered a broken bone(s), to avoid unnecessary movement
and provide support, apply a Med-Brace (if available) or an improvised
splint.

- While treating the patient and afterward check the patient for the onset of
shock. If shock does occur treat it accordingly (see below).

It is your responsibility to ensure the patient is evacuated as soon as possible and
receives a full Med-Review and further medical attention if necessary.

As soon as possible after completing the CIM procedure fill the CIM Report Form, the
Diazamorphite Report Form (if used) and the patient's Medical Log.

4.7: Stages of Consciousness
There are four stages of consciousness that you need to remember.

- 1..Full consciousness, able to answer questions normally. Alert.

- 2..Drowsiness, answers simple questions, easily roused as they go uncon-
scious. Responds to voice. Voice

- 3..Stupor, unlikely to answer questions, difficult to rouse. Almost unaware of
outside stimuli. Responds to Pain. Pain.

- 4..Coma, cannot be roused at ail. Unresponsive.

This can be easily remembered by the mnemonic AVPU.

##### 4.8: Shock

When a patient is suffering from severe bleeding, broken bones,burns, crush injuries,
severe nerve stimulation, etc, they may go into clinical shock, ie. they suffer from a reduc-
tion of blood to their vital organs. This can occur very quickly after the injury was sus-
tained or over a much longer period, but can in itself prove fatal, regardless of serious-
ness of the injury.

It is therefore vital that the patient is treated for this condition if you think shock has set in,
or is likely to. A patient suffering from clinical shock may display some or ail of the follow-ing symptoms:

1. Gray/pallid, cold,moist skin.
2. Fast shallow breathing.
3. Rapid irregular pulse.
4. Dizziness.
5. Fainting.
6. Blurred vision.
7. Nausea and vomiting.
8. Thirst.
9. Anxiety, restlessness, may be aggressive.
10. Reduction in stage of consciousness (see above).

###### 4.8.1: Treatment for Clinical Shock

if you have diagnosed a patient as suffering from or likely to be suffering clinical shock,
treat the patient as described below:

1. Treat the injury that caused the shock if possible.
2. Reassure the patient at all times.
3. Lie the patient down, feet up and head down.
4. Loosen clothing around neck, wrists, chest and waist.
5. Lightly cover with a blanket.
6. Insulate patient from ground with a bianket.
7. Do not give the patient a drink. If they ask for a drink only allow them to
moisten their lips.
8. Avoid moving the patient if possible.
9. Do not apply a heat source to any part of the patients body, as this will
draw off more blood from the vital organs.
10. Keep a full record of patients pulse, respiration and level of conscious-
ness.
11. If patient reaches level 3 or 4 of consciousness put them into the recovery
position.
12. Ensure a full written report is completed.

### 5: Review

A Med-Tech 3:

- is responsible for the treatment of IR damage and many other types of in-
juries likely to be sustained in active service.
- must keep ail records up to date.

### 6: Assessed Written and Practical Examination

Following instructional session(s) the prospective Med-Tech 3 is required to take and
pass a written and practical examination before he or she is granted the Med-Tech
qualification.
