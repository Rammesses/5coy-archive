### 1: Introduction

The following document forms the course notes for those taking the CMC Med-Tech
Level 4 course (course no. CMC95/1M0101/A), and as such is required reading for that
course.

Evaluation of this course is by a supervised written examination.

### 2: Course Desription

The Mea-Tech 4 qualification is the minimum qualification required for a Marine to be
authorised to administer resuscitant drugs and perform IR screen repair procedures.
Performing such operations without the qualification may injure or kill the patient, and
will always lead to formal disciplinary proceedings.

### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: Introduction

Med-Tech 4 qualified Marines are required to operate the RVC-877 unit and administer
the dosage of drugs it prescribes. A Grade 4 Med-Tech is classified as a technician not
a medic.

Before any mission/exercise you will be issued with a standard RVC-877 Unit, and a
number of the resuscitation drugs.

##### 4.2: Incapacitating Radiation (IR)

Unshielded personal caught in IR suffer from seizures of the nervous system, causing
extreme pain, and an absorbtion of radiation into the brain, resulting in a coma.

To protect personel from the effects of IR, several types of screen have been developed,
two of which are currently being used by the CMC. To provide maximum protection
combined with ease of movement in combat, these screens are presently incorporated
into caps and helmets.

The 2 types of screen are:

**MS-CMC Military Issue**

Provides full protection from 5 direct IR bursts, but on the 6th the
amount of IR absorbed overloads the screen and the IR is
dumped into the wearer. This renders the wearer unconscious.

_Unless treatment is received within 30 minutes the damage
done will prove fatal._

**MS-CIV Civilian Issue**

Provides full protection from 5 direct IR bursts but on the 6th the
amount of IR absorbed overloads the screen and all the IR
absorbed by the screen is dumped into the wearer. This
invariably causes death. —

##### 4.3: Administration

Every time you treat a patient you must keep accurate records of what is wrong with the
patients and what action you take.

As a Med-Tech 4 you will have a limited number of procedures and drugs that yOu are
qualified and authorised to perform or use, but records must be kept.

As a Med-Tech 4 there are a number of administrative dutied you must perform. The
records generated must be as up to date as possible at all times.

1. When issued with medical drugs and equipment you must sign for
them. If you give any of your drugs or equipment to another
Med-Tech or other personel, then they must sign for it.

2. After you have resuscitated a patient you must record patient’s
name, the IDP reading (see later) and the drugs you
administered. This information goes into the patient’s Medical
Log.

3. When ever an overdose, deliberate or accidental occurs the
Overdose Report form must be filled in and the patient’s Medical
Log ammended accordingly. 

4. When the Emergency Override Procedure is used, all the
information on the Overdose Form must be filled i in, and
thepatient’s Medical Log ammended.

5. Negligent discharge of IR weapons is a disciplinary offense under
CMC regulations. If you witness an act of negligent discharge,
you are required to report it to the senior Med-Tech and the
senior officer on duty in writing.

If you fail to keep you Administration in order you are liableto have your Med-Tech
status revoked and may face further disciplinary action.

* As a Med-Tech 4 you are prohibited from carrying or administering any drugs other than
those specifically mentioned below, unless given written permission by an officer or a
Med-Tech 1.

##### 4.4: The RVC-877 Unit

The RVC-877 Unit has a dual role. Its first is to check the patient’s screen and reset
the screen. The RVC-877 Unit in thehands of a Med-Tech can only be used for
resetting screens that have overloaded (ie. taken all 6 hits).

The second is to diagnose the level of IR the patient has absorbed and so what drugs
are needed to revive the patient.

###### 4.4.1: Operation of the RVC-877 Unit

Activate the RVC-877 Unit using the switch on the side of the unit..

**4.4.1.1: Operating the Screen Repair Program**

- To select the Screen Repair Program (SRP), depress the yellow pad. To activate the
- minimal program, depress the red pad.

One of the 4 colored pads will then light up, accompanied by an identifying tone. You >
must duplicate the unit's pattern by depressing the same pad. If successful, the unit
will add another pad and it’s accompanying tone to the sequence, which again you
must repeat exactly.

lf at any point in the SRP sequence the wrong pad is depressed, an error tone will be
heard, and the unit will reselect the SRP. Depress the red pad to to re-activate the
minimal program.

A successful SRP will be indicated by the "routine completed" tone. The screen can
then be manually reset and placed back on the patient's head.

Deactivate the RVC-877 Unit then reactivate the unit.

**4.4.1.2: Operating the Injury Diagnostic Program**

To select the Injury Diagnostic Program (IDP) depress the green pad.

A light will appear on one of the nine nodes shown on the display. Using the 4 pads to
indicate the direction you wish the light to move, you must trace the units path
through the diagnostic routine. If you depress the wrong pad, the unit will return to the
Start of the IDP. Note, that unless the unit is deactivated it will retain the same path.
To complete the IDP the light must exit the grid via one of the display walls.

Upon successfully exiting from the grid, the "routine successful" tone will be heard, |
and the dose required to treat the level of IR absorbed by the patient will be
illuminated. This will be inthe range 1 to 9.

Administer the stated dose (see below).

Deactivate the RVC-877 Unit after use.

##### 4.5: Treatment for IR Absorbtion

Before any drugs are administered you must check the patient's monitoring card to
~ ensure the card still has either blue or green dots on it still. /f it has no blue or green
dots on it a higher level Med-Tech must be found to treat the patient.

###### 4.5.1: IR Resuscitant Drugs

For use with the RVC-877 Unit there are three types of drugs, all of which come in
two forms.

1. Intravenous. The drug name is suffixed with an (i).
2. Ingested. The drug name is suffixed with a (b).

Always use the suffix when writing drug names down.

The three drugs are listed below with brief descriptions.

* GARATIN - Level 1 Resuscitant.
  - Garatin (i) - Colorless liquid.
  - Garatin (b) - Small white capsule.

* HYDRATIL - Level 2 Resuscitant.
  - Hydratil (i) - Clear red liquid.
  - Hydratil (b) - Green capsule.

* DEFALICIL - Level 3 Resuscitant.
  - Defalicil (i) - Clear blue liquid.
  - Defalicil (b) - Orange capsule.

You must issue a selection of these drugs so they counter the IR absorbed by the
patient to the value the IDP indicates.

Example: A patient has according to the IDP received a dose severity of 4, so the
doses that could be administered would be:

* 2 Hydratil - 2 level 2’s making level 4
* 1 Garatin & 1 Defalicil - 1 level 1 and one level 3 making level 4
* 4 Garatin - 4 level 1’s making level 4

You must monitor carefully the number and type of each drug administered, ensuring
that as equal a mix as possible is issued.

Once you have administered the drugs make sure you remove the top dot on 1 the
patient’s monitoring card and return the card.

As soon as practicable the patients medical log must be ammended.

###### 4.5.2: Overdoses

If it is impossible to to administer the exact dose needed (due to a short-fall in drugs),
then you must issue a dose that is as little as possible above the level required. Make
sure an Overdose Report Form is filled in as well as ammending the patient's medical
log and that the Overdose Procedure is followed (see below).

###### 4.5.3: Emergency Override Procedure

In cases of extreme urgency, the IDP can be overridden, and a dose of level 9
resuscitants administered. This procedure is only to be adopted in emergency
situations as a resulting reaction in the patient could prove fatal. Authorisation for this
procedure must be obtained from an officer or Med-Tech 1. The Overdose Report
Form must be filled in as well as ammending the patient’s medical log, and the
Overdose Procedure followed (see below).

###### 4.5.4: Overdose Procedure

If an overdose has been administered to a patient (whether accidentally 0 or aS a matter
of necessity), the following procedure must be followed:

Record the patient’s name and number, the date and time of
issue, the damage diagnosed by the IDP (if applicable) and
the dose administered.

Keep a close eye on the patient for adverse reactions to the
overdose, and make sure the patients squad members, and
especially his CO are aware of what has happened.

On completion of the exercise/mission, you must submit a full
report, written, of what happened to the senior medic on duty.

It is your responsibility to ensure that as soon as possible the
patient attends a medical.

If you fail to follow the Overdose Procedure you are liable to have your Med-Tech
Status revoked and may face further disciplinary action.

### 5: Review

A Med-Tech Level 4

* is responsible for diagnosing and resuscitating IR casualties
* is responsible for casualty support
* must maintain appropriate records at all times.
* must ensure monitoring card is up to date. ©

### 6: Assessed Written Examination

Following instructional sessions, the prospective Med-Tech Level 4 is required to take
and pass a written examination before he or she is granted the Med-Tech 4 qualification.
