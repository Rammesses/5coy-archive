### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: Introduction

A marine qualified in patrolling is expected to be able to navigate their way around un-
familiar surroundings using a map and/or compass and on return to base, be abie to give
a clear and concise report on what they saw and what happened.

Good patrolling will enable HQ to build up an accurate picture of what the enemy is up to,
and will aiso inhibit the enemy from building up forces in the patrolled area to iaunch a
surprise attack.

##### 4.2: Types of Patrolling

There are a number of types of patrols that can be sent out.Before setting out on a patrol
you must make sure you are aware of the sort of patrol you are being sent out on. In all
cases the patrols must be ready and prepared to fight.

###### 4.2.1: Reconnaissance Patrol

This sort of patrol should normally be carried out by trained scouts, who in a small group
two to four men go out for a specific mission. This sort of patrolling requires the greatest
use of field craft, and the object is to look for the enemy and gather intelligence, not
engage them.

###### 4.2.2: Fighting Patroi

Fighting patrols should consist of six to twelve men, with at least one heavy weapon.
Often sent out to engage the enemy and bring back prisoners for interrogation. They are
sometimes used to back up a Reconnaissance patrol. To enable the recon patrol to be
able to take greater risks knowing they have backup.

###### 4.2.3: Protective Patrol

Protective patrols should consist of four to eight men. They are sent out in the immediate
area of a base to ensure the enemy cannot launch a surprise attack.

###### 4.3.4: General Patrol

General patrols are really a combination of Fighting and Protective patrols. The patrol
should consist of at least four men. Often used when moving into a new area, when the
position and presence of enemy troops is unknown.

##### 4.3 Map and Compass

###### 4.3.1: Introduction

When patrolling it is essential that all members of the squad understand and know how to
use maps and compasses in conjunction with each other.

###### 4.3.2: Conventional Signs

A conventional sign is the name given to a symbol which is used to indicate on a map a
feature or object which occurs on the ground.

The symbols represent natural and man-made features, and as far as possible the
symbols are drawn so as to look as far as possible like the things they represent.

The symbols are not always drawn to scale and may be much larger on the map than
they really are. If this is so the center of the symbol is where the feature Is.

On most maps there is a key, for the meaning of the symbols used on the map. When out
patrolling you will not have time to constantly refer to the key so you must know the
symbols relevant to your map.

###### 4.3.3: Scale and Distance

By scale is meant the proportion the distance between two points on the map bears
towards the distance between the same points on the ground.

Maps come in varying scales, typically 1:50,000 and 1:25,000,though other scales are
used. This means when using a map you must be aware of the scale of the map you are
using, and how to scale up the distances on the map, to real distance on the ground.

When measuring distances off a map, bear in mind that obstacles,hills and depressions
may all add to the distance that would be traversed.

###### 4.3.4: Contours

Contour lines show on a flat piece of paper, the rises and falls of the ground it is
representing. The contours show points of equal height above sea level. The closer lines
are to each other therefore the more extreme the change in level, whether it is arise or
fall can be gauged in two ways:

**Reading the contour lines values.**

Look at the terrain around:

- Rivers dont flow up hill.
- Rivers running along contour lines are usually at the bottom of a valley.
Settlements and large woods tend to be at the bottom of hills.

###### 4.3.5: Grid References

A map is criss-crossed with vertical and horizontal lines,known as Grid Lines Each line
being identified by a two-figured number. The vertical lines are known as “eastings” for
though individually they run up and down the map, aa whole they are numbered from left
to right. The horizontal lines are known as‘“northings’ though they run individuaily they run
left to right,as a whole they are numbered south to north.

Where two lines intersect you have a grid reference.

You can be more specific about features within the grid reference by dividing the squares
into tenths (6 digits) or hundreths (8 digits).

When giving a grid reference there are two rules to remember:-

1. A reference must always contain an even number of digits.
2. Always count along the lines from west to east, and then from south to
north.

Grid references are used on a map to pinpoint an area, or a specific feature or even
point. Grid references are usually given as either a six or eight figured number, depend-
ing on the accuracy that is required.

###### 4.3.6: Using a Compass

There are numerous types of compass in use within the CMC and you should ask your
instructor if you are unsure of how to use the specific type issued to you.

When using the compass you must be as accurate as possible at all times and be aware
that metals around the compass, such as overhead power lines, fences, metal buildings
can affect the compass accuracy.

###### 4.3.7: The Norths

There are three norths that exist. You should be aware of what they represent and how to
work with them.

- True north - is the direction of the north pole.
- Magnetic north - is the point to which a compass needle points. The dif-
ference between True and Magnetic north is known as the Magnetic
Variation. Magnetic north varies from year to year and planet to planet.
On the key of most maps the magnetic variation should be given or the
information necessary to calculate it. If the information is not on the
map, you should find out the variation from some other source, before
using the map and compass together.
Grid north - Since the grid lines are in parallel they cannot all be pointing to true
north. However except for very long distances they can be considered to be show-
ing true north. There should however be on the map the information required to
work out the error if it is needed.

**4.3.7.1: Converting Bearings**

A true bearing cannot be measured directly, but must be converted from one of the other
two.

To convert a magnetic bearings taken by a compass to a true bearing you need to
Subtract the Magnetic Variation. This can be easily remembered by the mnemonic

MUGS - Magnetic Unto Grid Subtract

To convert a grid bearing to a magnetic bearing you must Add the Magnetic Variation.
This can be easily remembered by

GUMA - Grid Unto Magnetic Add

###### 4.3.8: Setting the Map

A map can be set in two ways, either by using the compass, or visible land marks. In both
cases what you are doing is setting the map to point to north.

setting maps by visible land marks is simply turning the map till the features around you
match those that appear on the map.it is important to note that you most use features
that cannot move. This method is not as accurate as using a compass.

To set a map by compass you must first set the compass to north and then add the mag-
netic variation to the compass then align the map to the lines in the compass housing.

###### 4.3.9: Re-Section

lf on the move you need to find your position accurately the method of Re-section. This
involves finding two features or landmarks that are approximately at right angles and
some distance apart.

You take bearings to these two points using the compass and note these Magnetic
bearings. These need converting to Grid Bearings.

Therefore you will need to take the bearings you have and subtract (MUGS) the magnetic
variation. The two bearings you have are then plotted onto the map. Use chinagraph
paper to avoid damaging the map. Where the two lines intersect is your position.

###### 4.3.10: Moving Around Obstacles

When on a pre-planned march an obstacle occurs that has to be avoided there are two
methods of avoiding the obstacle whilst still remaining on course.

1. Using the compass you turn 90° to the left or right and walk on this course
till you have past the obstacle, then turn 90° the opposite to what you did
at first and walk the same number of paces on this course as you did on
the first leg. Once this has been done you should if done correctly be
able to turn back to your original course and be on the same track as you
started on. |

2. When the obstacle is encountered using the compass turn to 60° to the
left or right of your original course, keep count of the paces and waik till
past the obstacle, then turn 120° the opposite way to the original 60°.
Walk the same number of paces as the first leg. Turn back to your original
course and you should be on the same track and course as before the
obstacle.

###### 4.3.11: Plotting Routes

When planning a mission a route has to be worked out before leaving, with a route out
and possibly a different route back in. You should not ever mark a map therefore a route
card should be made up eg.

^^^
ETD 1800 Mag-Var: 6'w
Grid Ref LegNo. Bearing’ Distance ETA

000-000 1 180 3km 1845
000-970 2 270 500m 1900 Cross Stream
^^^ 

###### 4.3.12: Pacing

During the march when pacing of distances is required a technique that can be used is
for two men in the patrol to act as. They keep count of the number of paces between leg
points, if a distance is needed by taking the average of the two you should be able to get
a good approximation of the distance travelled. The patrol ieader should try to get two
men with roughly similarly sized paces.

###### 4.3.13: Course Log

When following a route it is the job of a patrol leader to take notes on the route as well as
the final objective. The sort of information that will needed to be recorded is quite varied
but the some examples are recorded below:-

Grid Ref Time Leg No. Dist into Leg
What Brg Range

If you have gone around a obstacle you would need to record where you altered course,
what to and for how long and/or how many paces. Also if you find new features that are
not on your maps of the area they will have to be recorded.

##### 4.4: Pre-Patro!l Checks

Prior to moving out on a mission there are a number of checks that should be made. The
CO of the patrol is responsible for finding out much of the list below, but all marines going
out on the patrol should be aware of the information.

###### 4.4.1: Units in Area of Operation

suspected enemy/ neutral/ friendly forces, numbers and movements of.

###### 4.4.2: The Mission Details

- Objective.
- ETD.
- ETA (objective).
- ETA (base).

- Comms links to HQ- Radio procedure and codes.

###### 4.4.5: Camouflage

- Refer to Basic Training Manual.
- Noise - Rattle.

###### 4.4.6: Administration

- Operations informed
- Patrol Record Form raised and section 1-3 completed.

##### 4.5: Hand signals

The list below are the hand signals that will be taught on the course that you should
know. The second list are hand signals that should be reviewed from basic training.

###### 4.5.1: Tactical Hazards

When giving hand signals for Tactical hazards, things that will cause an increase chance
of detection, two signals need to be given. The first is to clench the fists and cross the
arms across the body, with the fist touching opposite shoulders. This is foilowed by a
hand signal to specify what sort of tactical hazard has been encountered.

- Path - one finger drawn across the body.
- Track - two fingers drawn across the body.
- Road - three fingers drawn across the body.
- Building - the arms are raised above the head, with the fingers touching.
- Fence - one finger pointing outward, make the hand make circular motions
moving across the body.
- Water - one hand making up and down curved motions drawn across the
body.
- Mine/ Trap - the fist is repeatedly open and shut quickly.

###### 4.5.2: Stealth Attack

The hand signal for a stealth attack, incapacitating the enemy quietly is to draw one
hand across the throat.

###### 4.5.3: Basic Training Hand Signals

You should know these hand signals, if you have any doubts refer to the Basic Training
Manual.

ERV ARD Freeze
Down Carry On
Enemy Seen or Suspected
Hasty Ambush

##### 4.6: Waiks and Crawis

You should know these walks and crawls, if you have any doubts refer to the Basic
Training Manual.

Ghost walk High Crawl
Low crawl Very low crawl

Remember when moving you should keep movemenis as siow as time and terrain will

allow. Try not to move too regularly either.When moving keep searching for your next
piece of cover that you can go to if you come under fire.

##### 4.7: Night Vision

At night and low light conditions you see shapes but little detail and skylining is often
even more noticeable than during the day. To see well at night there are techniques that
you should employ.

- Dark adaptation - Night vision takes approximately 1/2 hour to be fully effec-
tive. This can be reduced by the wearing of red goggles for 20 minutes
then in the dark for 10 minutes.
- Avoid staring, look at a slight angie left or right, up or down.
- Keep scanning around an object you are looking at, moving you eyes every
few seconds.

##### 4.8: Debriefing

Once you have returned from a patrol, it is necessary to do a full debrief. this involves
making sure you have all the information properly collated and in an understandable
form.The list Delow show the sort of information you should include in a report. This
information will normally be entered into the Patrol Report Form that should have been
raised with the Operations Officer before the Patrol went out.

- To:
- Maps
- A Size and composition of patrol.
- B Mission.
- C Time departed.
- D Time returned.
- E Routes used.
- F Terrain (out and back).
- G Any map corrections.
- H Enemy.
- | Results of any encounters with the enemy.
- J Miscellaneous information.
- K Condition of patrol.
- L Conclusion and recommendations.
- Signed. Rank. Unit. Date.
- M Additional remarks.
- Debriefing Officer Signature.

###### 4.8.1: Enemy Information

When reporting on the enemy an easy way to remember what to report is to use the
letters of the word SALUTE.

* S - Size 
* A - Activity 
* L - Location
* U -  Unit - If known.
* T - Time
* E - Equipment

##### 4.9: Administration & Tactical Operations

As has been mentioned above, the Patrol Report Form is the standard method of
administering a Patrol of any type, although Guard Patrols would not normally complete
such a form.

Its raising before the patrol leaves by either the Unit CO, the Patrol Leader of the
Operations Officer, and logged into the Operations system. Sections 1 to 3 must be
completed before the patrol leaves the base.

- Section 1 is completed by the Operations Officer (OlC(Ops)), and covers
objectives, authorisation, classification and ensures that Rules-Of-
Engagement and Intelligence briefings have been given.

- Section 2 is completed by the Patroi Leader, and details the planned route
and checkpoints, as well as the expected duration of the patrol.

- Section 3 is completed by the Operations Officer or Deck Officer just before
the patrol leaves and details the patrol composition and the actual time of
departure. This ensures that a log is kept so that overdue patrols can be
identified immediately, and appropriate measures taken.

When the patrol returns, the Patrol Report Form is completed by the Patrol Leader and
Unit Commander.

- Section 4 is completed by the Patrol Leader and covers the disposition of the
returning patrol (injuries, casualties, etc), and a full debrief report of the
patrol.

- Section 5 is completed by the Unit Commander, who signs off the report and
notes any additional recommendations arising from the report.

### 5: Review

A marine qualified in Patrolling should be able prepare for and then move around the
battlefield as ordered and report on anything seen.

### 6: Assessed Written and Practical Examination:

Following instructional session(s) you are required to take a written examination and
practical examination before being granted the Patrolling qualification.
