### 4: Course Notes

##### 4.1: What is an Armourer?

The term Armourer is used to describe a Marine trained and qualified in the issue, opera-
tion and basic repair of IR weapons and screens systems.

###### 4.1.1: Responsibilities of an Armourer

The armourer is required to issue and receive weapons and screens and to participate in
the normal operation of the field armoury.

He is also required to participate in the normal Marine combat operations, and to perform
specialist armourer functions, particularly running the Screen Repair Program, under field
conditions.

###### 4.1.2: Training and Advancement

Armourer-4 may be regarded as the basic qualification for those wishing to become
involved in the technical aspects of IR weaponry and screen systems. The training
provides a solid grounding in the underlying theory of IR weapons and screens,their
operation and basic repair and the operation of a field armoury. The field role of the
armourer especially his ability to repair personal screens, makes it desirable for as many
people as possible to undertake this training.

Further training and advancement may be taken in armourer duties.

###### 4.1.3: Course Structure

The Armourer-4 course is presented as an informal lecture covering the syllabus, includ-
ing demonstrations of the skilis to be fearned and an opportunity to practice them.

For final qualification, trainees are required to take and pass a written examination and to
demonstrate their proficiency at the practical skills necessary to undertake armourer
duties.

##### 4.2: Theoretical Data on Incapacitating Radiation

'IR' was first discovered as a naturally-occurring phenomenon by early space explorers in
2200, and was determined as the cause of many un-explained spaceship disappearances. 
Once a means of shielding had been discovered, exploration continued unchecked. 
The potential of IR as a weapon was apparent, and it was not long before
means of artificially had aiso been developed. After the devastation of the Colonial War
IR weapons were adopted as the only legal form of weaponry with the Projectile Weapon
Treaty.

###### 4.2.1: How it affects you

IR is a form of Electromagnetic Radiation, which acts upon the target’s nervous system
When personal are hit by [R whether shielded or not it causes an electrical storm in the
brain. To protect itself the brain releases a chemical, Diazatrophin, to block the nerve
ends and prevent further damage and stimulation. The larger the dose of IR the larger the
electrical storm and the more Diazatrophin is released. Eventually there is so much
Diazatrophin in the brain that all messages to and from the brain are stopped and coma
followed by death occurs.

###### 4.2.2: How the Screens Protects You

IR is put out as an un-polarised beam and the systems currently in use put out a
polarised field which has a limited capacity to absorb IR, at least in part. Some always
gets though, but this has little effect on the wearer apart from brief bursts of
pain.However, no effective mechanism for absorbing and storing large amounts of IR
have yet to be developed in a size suitable for a man-portable device, and the screens
currently on issue have a limited capacity before they fail, flooding their immediate vicinity
which includes the wearer with IR.

##### 4.3: Weapon and Screen Systems

Whilst undertaking the duties of an armourer, it is likely that an individual will be required
to handle a wide range of IR weapons and various screen systems, and it is essential
that all armourers are capable of operating them safely.

###### 4.3.1: Legal Responsibilities of Weapon Handling

Negligent discharge of 1R weapons is a disciplinary offense under CMC regulations. If
you witness an act of negligent discharge, you must report it to the senior Armourer and
the senior officer on duty in writing. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action
against you.

Armourers are aiso reminded of the United Worids prohibition against the possession or
use of projectile weapons, and that it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between
them and IR weapons at first glance. The mere possession of a projectile weapon can
attract a death sentence and if in any doubt of the nature of a weapon the armourer
concerned should inform his superiors immediately.

###### 4.3.2: Survey of Equipment in Use

**4.3.2.1: IR Weapons**

The CMC issues weapons as required to Marines at the start of each operation from its
stock of standard weapons However, it is CMC policy to allow Marines to use the IR
weapon of their choice,and many individuals choose to provide their own —
weapons.Armourers are advised to become familiar with those used by other members of
any unit in which they serve, but are reminded that the repair and maintenance of a
privately-owned weapon is the responsibility of its owner.

**4.3.2.1.1:** Standard issue Sidearm

The main weapon in use within the CMC is the Standard Issue Sidearm, the Starlyte
pistol.

###### 4.3.2.2: Screen Systems

There are two forms of personal screen available.

**4.3.2.2.1: MS-CMC**

The normal issue CMC screen, known as MS-CMC, is mounted normaily in a light protec-
tive helmet, and all the electric, sensors and the power ceil are contained within helmet.
When operational, the screen's function is indicated by a pulsing red light on the external
read-out panel and an audible signal (the “bleep’). This bleep is normally only audible to
the wearer, being transmitted by bone conduction from a smail speaker. The tone of the
bleep can be a useful diagnostic in assessing power cell strength.

**4.3.2.2.2: MS-CIV**

The other form of screen available is the civilian screen, known as MS-CIV. This is
normally supplied as a self contained clip on unit, often worn on a belt. Operational state
is again shown by an external light display and audible tone, which is louder than that
emitted by a MS-CMC screen.

**4.3.2.2.3: Differences and Similarities between MS-CMC and MS-CIV Screens**

With both types of screen, a direct iRi hit is marked by an audible tone. The current
absorption state of the screen is shown by coloured lights on the external read-out panel
and by the frequency of the operational bleep signal (which increases as more IR is
absorbed). both types of screens are capable of absorbing up to five direct hits with
minimal effect on the wearer, Dut a spth hit will cause failure, with the {RR stored in the
screen being released from the hoiding field into the wearer's body causing unconscious-
ness with MS-CMC and death with MS-CIV.

The main differences between the MS-CIV and MS-CMC screens are the latter does not
dump all the stored IR onto the wearer so causes unconsciousness leading to death.

The MS-CIV dumps all the stored IR into the wearer causing death. The MS-CIV cannot
be reset after failure, the MS-CMC can be reset at any time.

It is not possible to wear more than one activated and functioning screen at one time as
the polarised protective fields interact, rendering the wearer vulnerable to any IR in the
vicinity.

###### 4.3.2.3: RVC 878

The RVC 878 unit is a small package that can be used in the field or on base to repair
screens damaged by IR by running the Screen Repair Program (SRP).

###### 4.3.2.4: RVC 877C

The RVC 877C Unit has a number of medical programs and is slightly larger than the
RVC 878 Unit. it is normally issued to medtechs. It does have a SRP that armourers can
use to repair damaged screens.

###### 4.4.3.5: Use of the RVC 378 and 877C units Together

The 878 Units can be used in close proximity to each other. However the 878 and 877
units must not be used any closer than 2m to each other as there is a high risk of them
interfering with each other's programs. This is particulary important if the 877C Unit is
being used to determine drug dosages to be given ,as it may give faise results.

##### 4.3.3: Operation of Weapons and Screen Systems

##### 4.3.3.1: Weapon Operation

The standard CMC issue IR weapon is extremely easy to use. it is provided with an
aiming sight mounted above the barrel, which is activated by first pressure on the trigger.
It is essential that the lens in the muzzie is kept clean and clear of any mud or other
debris - as well as disrupting or obscuring the IR beam this may cause scratching or
abrasion of the lens, leading to permanent degradation of weapon function.

Ail CMC issue weapons are capable of being switched into training mode, when a harm-
less beam of similar characteristics to the normal IR one emitted. A weapon in training
mode is capable of registering “hits” on either type of screen, and even triggering over-
load failure, but without causing harm to the wearer.

There are various devices used to switch the weapons between modes. Ensure you are
instructed in the operation of the device your unit is issued with.

##### 4.3.3.2: Screen Operation

Both types of screen are initialised by means of a simple switch. A brief series of tones
indicate that the self-test function is being run, then the normal operational bieep ts
heard. However, it is not possible to just turn a screen off,even if it has not sustained any
direct IR hits, it requires to be powered down in a controlled manner. This is because the
protective field it generates will have absorbed any stray IR in the environment and if it
was to be merely switched off, the IR would be released into the immediate area, with
potential disastrous effects.

**4.3.3.2.1: Routine Power Down of Screens**

Any screen which has been activated should be powered in a controlled manner. If no
direct IR hits have taken by the screen, this may be done by disconnecting the power
Supply - any stray IR which has been absorbed by the screen will slowly dissipated into
the environment with the minimal danger to personal in the area.

**4.3.3.2.2: Screen Repair of Failed Screens**

lf a screen has taken six hits and subsequently failed the screen can be reset by using a
RVC 878 Unit or a RVC 877 Unit.

**4.3.3.2.2.1: Screen Repair using the RVC-878 Unit**

- Activate the RVC-878 Unit
- A tone will be then heard to confirm the unit is operating.
- To start the Screen Repair Program (SRP), depress the button next to the red
diode.
- One of the 4 diodes will then light up, accompanied by an identifying tone.
You must duplicate the unit’s pattern by depressing the same pad. If
successful, the unit will add another light and it's accompanying tone to
the sequence, which again you must repeat exactly.
- If at any point in the SRP sequence the wrong pad is depressed,an error tone
will be heard. if a green light flashes 5 times the unit has successfully
completed the SRP. If unsuccessful a red light will flash five times. In both
cases the unit will re-select the SRP.
- If a successful SRP nas been indicated by the green lights the screen can
then be manually reset and placed back on the patient's head.
- In the case of failure try the SRP again

**4.3.3.2.2.2: Screen Repair Using the RVC-877 Unit**

- Activate the RVC-877 Unit.
- To select the Screen Repair Program (SRP), depress the yellow pad. To
activate the minimal program, depress the red pad.
- One of the 4 colored pads will then light up, accompanied by an identifying
tone. You must duplicate the unit's pattern by depressing the same pad. If
successful, the unit will add another pad and it's accompanying tone to
the sequence, which again you must repeat exactly.
- If at any point in the SRP sequence the wrong pad is depressed, an error
tone will be heard, and the unit will re-select the SRP.Depress the red
pad to activate the minimal program.
- A successful SRP will be indicated by the “routine completed” tone. The
screen can then be manually reset and placed back on the patient's
head.

**4.3.3.2.3: Screen Repair of Partially-Hit Screens**

if a screen has taken hits but not yet failed, the IR that is being contained must be
removed before or during the SRP. There are a number of Portabie De-activation Units
available, such as the G360. Ensure you are taught how to use the type that is issued to
your unit.

it is important to be sure when repairing a screen that as the wearer will have no protec-
tion from IR while the repair is taking place they are in a screened building or a safe area.

**4.3.3.3: Screen Faiture due to Cell Exhaustion**

The power cells in the screens can and do fail out in the field and to cater for this ar-
mourers should carry a number of spare cells.

If a screen faiis you should inform the CO so the unit does not use IR weapons while
dealing with the downed screen. The wearer should adopt the AIR drill position.
Deactivate the screen,remove the old cell and replace with the new cell. Re-activate the
screen and replace it on the wearer's head. Keep the packaging from the new cell and
the oid ceil, returning them to the armory, when you return to base.

##### 4.4: issue of Screens and Weapons

Prior to active service or a training mission, the issue of screen and weapons to all per-
sonal will be necessary. The Senior Armourer will have checked all equipment before it is
issued,and will supervise weapon screen issue. For security and record keeping pur-
poses, it is necessary to issue all items against signature.

###### 4.4.1: Administrative Duties.

7\W01 Weapons issue Form (951/001/A) should be used when a weapon is issued. The
marine receiving the weapon must insert his name (legibly) and sign in the appropriate
spaces on the form.Once the weapon is signed for, it becomes the responsibility of that
Marine until the weapon is signed back into the Armory.

7801 Equipment Issue Form (951/002/A) should be used for the issue of all other items
of equipment, including screens. Again the Marine receiving the item is required to sign
for the item(s) received, and ts responsible for them unti they are signed back into the
Armory.

When the issue procedures are completed, the forms should be returned to the Senior
Armourer.

###### 4.4.2: Replacement of U/S Kit

if a Marine brings in a faulty piece of equipment, weapon or screen, its return shouid be
logged using 7S01 Equipment Fault/Failure Form (951/003/A). Note as much detalis as
possible about the fault, and record whether it has been repaired in the field or is beyond
local repair.

A replacement item (if necessary) should be issued using the appropriate form.

The equipment Fault/Failure Form should be returned to the Senior Armourer at the
earliest opportunity, along with item({s)removed from service and not yet repaired. All
such items should be ciearly iabelied with as much information as possibie concerning
the fault, to assist the repair technicians later.

##### 4.5: Practical Session.

The practical aspects of the course include gaining hands on familiarity with all items of
equipment mentioned during the course, and practice with the operation of the SRP on
the RVC 878 Unit and RVC 877 Unit.

### 5. Review

An Armourer

- is trained in the issue, operation and basic repair of weapons and screens
- accompanies Marines in the field to provide screen repair services
- must adhere to the rules pertaining to the armourer function

### 6. Assessed Written Test and Practical Session.

Following the instructional sessions, the prospective Armourer is required to take and
pass both a written test and an assessed practical session before he is granted the
Armourer-4 qualification.
