# M99A UWS Operating Manual.

## 1. Introduction.

This operating manual covers normal operation of the M99A Unmanned Weapons 
System (UWS), commonly known as a 'sentry gun'. This weapon will normally 
be operated by Armourer-trained personnel under direction from the CED 
Chief and mission commanders.

## 2. The Unmanned Weapons System.

The M99A UWS consists of a single man-portable unit comprising both 
movement sensors and IR projectors. It may be placed in a suitable 
position to provide automatic defence for a position; and there is also a 
timed release mode which allows the unit to leave an 'unpleasant surprise' 
for hostile forces.

The M99A UWS will be prepped before use by Armourer-trained personnel but 
may be, under exceptional circumstances, positioned and activated by any 
Marine.

## 3. The Sensor System.

A white dome in the centre of the unit contains a motion detector which 
can detect any movements to the front of the UWS within an 8 metre arc.

## 4. Modes of Operation.

The M99A UWS can operate in several modes, which are: -

### 4.1. 'Mine' mode - in this mode the UWS will fire at any movement within 
sensor range, delivering a high energy encapsulated pulse of IR energy. 
There is then a 10 second delay as the unit reinitialises before it is 
able to deliver a further pulse of IR. When in this mode, the unit emits a 
slight 'ticking' noise and two red lights flash alternately, allowing an 
alert Marine to detect its presence and avoid its arc of fire.

### 4.2. 'Sentry' mode - in this mode (the most commonly used), the UWS - via 
a voice chip - issues a 'challenge' whenever movement is detected within 
sensor range, and then fires a burst of encapsulated pulses of IR. A 
traversing red light is visible as well as the audible warning.

### 4.3. 'Time-bomb' mode - in this mode, the UWS may be set for a delay of 1 
to 16 minutes, after which it will release the IR stored within the unit. 
When in operation, minutes are counted down on the signal lights on the 
face of the unit, and tenths of seconds on the digital display (if 
fitted).

## 5. Initialising the UWS.

Initialisation of the M99A UWS will normally be carried out by 
Armourer-trained personnel. The unit is powered up by means of the M98A 
ICS-K unit (the system has been designed so as to utilise the same device 
as used for powering up the M98A ICS for standardisation reasons). A 
single red light will flash, its position indicating which of the above 
modes is in operation. There are eight red lights across the face of the 
unit, counting from the left as you face it, # 4 indicates 'mine' mode, # 
5 indicates 'sentry' mode and # 7 indicates 'time-bomb' mode.

If any other than the desired mode is indicated, the mode may be changed 
by pressing the arming switch while operating the M98A ICS-K unit. The red 
light in position # 1 will flash rapidly. Each subsequent press of the 
arming switch will move the light one position to the right, until the 
desired mode is selected.

## 6. Arming the UWS.

Once initialised, and the correct mode set, the unit is now in the 'ready 
to be armed' state. In this state, it may be safely carried and positioned 
without risk to personnel. If 'time-bomb' mode has been selected, the 
delay may be set by holding an M98A ICS-R unit to the casing beside the 
arming switch until the required delay is shown on the display. Removing 
the M98A ICS-R unit causes the chosen delay to be stored in the unit's 
memory.

When the UWS has been placed in the designated location, the arming switch 
should be pressed once. Personnel then have a period of eight seconds to 
clear the area before the unit becomes active. This period is shown by a 
count-down on the eight green lights on the face of the unit.

## 7. Deactivating the UWS.

### 7.1. The normal method of deactivating a UWS is by means of a M98A ICS-K 
unit. Care should be taken in approaching the unit to remain outside of 
its sensor arc.

### 7.2. The count-down in 'time-bomb' mode may be halted by placing a M98A 
ICS-R unit against the casing adjacent to the arming switch. Upon pressing 
the arming switch, the unit returns to the 'ready to be armed' state, and 
the delay is reset to that initially selected.

### 7.3. A UWS in 'mine' mode may be temporarily deactivated for a period of 
10 seconds by concentrated fire. A UWS in 'sentry' mode may be similarly 
deactivated for a period of 30 seconds.

## 8. Low Power.

If the unit runs low on power, a 'beep' will be heard once every two 
seconds until the power cells are replenished. Power cells are inserted 
into the base of the unit alongside the arming switch. This should only be 
done by a senior Armourer who has been trained in this procedure.
