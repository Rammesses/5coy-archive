DRAFT 24/05/2495

### Aim

The aim of this document is to specify procedures for the conduct of ground based tactical
operations. In order for operations to proceed smoothly, any mission critical task must be ©
the specific responsibility of a nominated person. The objectives of this document are to:

- Identify the major tasks which must be carried out.
- Create posts within the unit command structure responsible for those tasks.
- Specify Terms Of Reference for these posts.
- Provide administrative tools to assist personnel in meeting their terms of
reference.

### MAJOR TASKS

There are currently five major tasks which need addressing:

1. Physical security of the Base Of Operations. 
   This involves the establishment of a Defensive Penmeter which is the 
   specific responsibility of a Guard Commander, within which Defensive 
   Sweeps are conducted.

2. Regulating the conduct of Patrols. 
   This involves the whole process, from the moment the Commanding Officer 
   establishes the need for a patrol to be conducted, through the briefing 
   of a Patrol Commander, the conduct of the patrol itself and finally the 
   recording and distribution of any information gathered.

3. Assignment of personnel to the various tasks which are occurring. 
   This involves the creation of an Operations Board which will be used by the
   Operations Officer to assign personnel to teams, and teams to tasks.

4. Regulating the flow of information between the unit and other Agencies. 
   This involves the establishment of a Signals Log.

(Out of character note: ‘Other agencies’ includes the referees!)

5. Gathering of all pertinent information in a central Mission Log and ensuring
all key personnel are aware of the latest information.

### Definitions

**Terms Of Reference** - A list detailing the precise duties associated with a particular
post. The individual concerned should be continually assessing whether the tasks
are being achieved, if not then the next person up the chain should be advised of
the shortcoming.

**Defensive Perimeter** - A designated area around the base of operations which is:

- access controlled for friendly personnel.
- entered by neutral personnel only when escorted.
- maintained free of all enemy personnel.
- regularly monitored for NBC hazards.

**Operations Board** - A board maintained under the guidance of the Operations
Officer showing an up to the minute tally of the disposition of the units personnel.

**Defensive Sweep** - A manoeuvre conducted by a group of marines to either
establish or confirm the security of the defensive perimeter. Sweeps are limited in
scope to operations planned to occur within the defensive perimeter, and as such
do not require any record keeping activity unless an unusual Occurrence happens.
Sweeps are initiated and controlled by the Guard Commander.

**Occurrence** - Any event which takes place within the defensive perimeter which the
Guard commander considers to have a bearing on the security of the perimeter; or
intelligence relating to the overall tactical situation. All occurrences are reported on
Form F/CMC/OPS03 (see annex E ) and filed in the mission log. Examples of things
worthy of an occurrence report:

- Contact within or firing into the defensive perimeter.
- NBC hazard detected.
- A sweep leaving the perimeter on the initiative of the personnel involved.

**Patrol** - a manoeuvre conducted by a group of Marines which is planned to extend
beyond the defensive perimeter. Patrol missions are set by the Commanding
Officer, and are led by a Patrol Commander. All patrols (even no contact) are
reported by Form F/CMC/OPS02 (see annex E) and filed in the mission log.

### POSTS

**Commanding Officer** - The Officer in overall charge of the unit. Terms Of
Reference are included at Annex A. However, it should be noted that a
commanding Officer is ultimately responsible for all the activities of the unit
commanded, the terms are more in the nature of limitations in authority.

**Operations Officer** - The Officer responsible for organising the unit in order to carry
out the tasks specified by the Commanding Officer. Terms Of Reference are
included at Annex B.

**Guard Commander** - The nominated individual, generally a junior officer or senior
NCO, responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the Defensive
Perimeter. Terms Of Reference are included at Annex C.

**Patrol Commander** - The nominated individual, generally the most senior assigned
to a particular patrol, responsible for commanding that patrol. Terms of reference
are included at Annex D.

**Patrol 2 IC** - The nominated individual, generally the second in seniority assigned
to a particular patrol, responsible for being second in command of that patrol.
Terms of reference are included at Annex (not yet drafted).

+ also Team Leaders / Squad leader TORs need doing, note these are on going
responsibilities rather than the specific tasks carried out for a Patrol. E.g. a Team
leader may be a Patrol Commander, if Patrol is one team only, similarly a Squad
leader may not be the Patrol Commander (if patrol more than 1 squad).

**FICMC/OPS0O2 - Patrol Form**

This will be an A4 sized form which is on an A3 sized piece of paper. A map of the
operating area is photocopied to the blank area. Purpose - to make patrols happen
efficiently, both ‘In Character’ and 'Out Of Character’, especially to make sure route is on
paper for reference by the referees, to make sure players and monsters meet up!

*Section 1* - Filled in by Operations to generate patrol.

- Mission Designator.

Immediately prior to departure, Patrol Leader & Operations Officer agree / confirm
personnel composition - Operations Board is amended to reflect this.

*Section 3* - Filled in by OperationsaAt the time of departure.

- Personnel (if not already completed).
- Time Of Departure
- Estimated Time Of Return
- Estimated Time Of Return & Overdue Action Time are noted on Ops Board.

When patrol returns, Patrol Leader reports to Operations and sets Ops Board team status
markers to ‘Reorg’., operations mark Actual Time Of Return.

**F/CMC/OPS03 - OCCURRENCE**

Purpose - to allow Guard Commander to report events within the Defensive Perimeter.
Content not yet considered but needs to be fairly open ended.

**FICMC/OPS04 - INTERVIEW**

Purpose - to formalise ‘interview’ (i.e. interrogation). As well as (/ instead of?) individual
notes taken by onlookers, provide a clipboard with these forms on it. This is to ensure that
vital information is recorded and in a fileable (and therefore findable) format. Content not
yet considered but should direct the interviewer to suitable 'open' questions (what / why /
how / who / when etc.).

**F/CMC/COMMS01 - SIGNALS**

Purpose - to regulate flow of information to and from the unit. Unit and referees would keep
a file which represents a secure comms terminal. We would send messages by placing a
signals form in the other file. When voice messages are sent to the players, recipient would
record the main points on the form and file it in the mission log. Content not yet considered
but based on current service signals form as it has all the required stuff (security
Classification, authorisation, addressees, priority). We could prepare standard versions for
Sitreps etc, Scenario Author could also pre prepare, thereby reducing 'time in' workload.

**FICMC/ICOMMS02 - SIGNALS LOG**

An index of F/-CMC/COMMS0's, held in mission log.

---

### ANNEX F

##### MISSION LOG

Exact content not yet considered, but a file (perhaps several) having several sections:

- Mission Orders.
- Current Rules Of Engagement.
- Table Of Organisation.
- Operations Log.
- Patrols pending.
- Patrols active.
- Patrols completed.
- Occurrences.
— Interviews.
- Signals Log.

- Commanding Officers Section (classified material and summary)

The file would be considered to be a phys rep of a secure computer terminal.

At the end of the mission this would form the basis of a mission report. Everything
significant which occurred would have been recorded in one place. We could then produce,
for the cost of the copying, partial or full mission reports for players / staff.
