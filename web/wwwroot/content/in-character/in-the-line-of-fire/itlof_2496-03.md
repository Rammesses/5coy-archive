ONWARD AND THE HOT NEWS THIS MONTH IS THE FOLLOWING STORY :-

### CROSSROADS 329 

 LAST MONTH IN THE LINE OF FIRE LEARNT OF A MASSIVE OFFENSIVE STARTING
ON PLANET , THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED HAS NOW EMERGED AND IN THE
LINE OF FIRE IS PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AS OF THE END OF FEBRUARY 2496
THE BLOCKADE HAS BEEN LIFTED AND C.M.C. FORCES HAVE STARTED TO STAND
DOWN IN THIS SECTOR . IT APPEAR'S THAT AN ATTACK WAS PLANNED IN FEBRUARY
AND AS THIS ATTACK UNFOLDED LESS AND LESS RESISTANCE WAS ENCOUNTERED
, DURING THIS ATTACK SEVERAL REPORTS FILTERED THROUGH THAT SHUTTLES
WERE SEEN TO BE LEAVING PLANET . THIS WAS FOLLOWED IN EACH CASE BY
MARINES ENCOUNTERING NO HOSTILE ACTIVITY IN EACH AREA IT IS BELIEVED
THAT THE HOSTILES WERE LEAVING PLANET BUT THIS WAS NOT CONFIRMED FOR
ALMOST TWO DAYS DUE TO BOOBY TRAPS LEFT IN THE AREA . SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
THE NAVAL BLOCKADE REPORTED SHUTTLES LEAVING SYSTEM 'COLD' WITH THEIR
IFF UNITS OFF HOWEVER ONE SHUTTLE WAS INTERCEPTED AND WAS FOUND TO
HAVE BEEN SCUTTLED AFTER THE CREW ABANDONED IT . THE SHUTTLE DID APPEAR
TO BE  A C.M.C. ONE .

 HOWEVER ALL IDENTIFYING MARKING'S HAD BEEN REMOVED ,  A NAVAL EXAMINATION
TEAM INFORMED US THAT THE SHUTTLE WAS THE SAME TYPE ISSUED TO C.M.C.
SPECIAL FORCES AND TO SOME CORPORATE SECURITY UNITS .

**THE OFFICIAL U.W. STATEMENT REPORTS** :-

    THE U.W. ARE PLEASED TO INFORM IT'S CITIZENS THAT THE ATTEMPTED
COUP ON CROSSROADS 329 WAS QUELLED ON THE 25 OF FEBRUARY 2496 .THE
COUP ATTEMPT , BY AN UNKNOWN FORCE BEGAN LAST SUMMER AND ENDED IN
A BLOODY FIREFIGHT LAST MONTH . ALMOST FORTY COMPANIES OF MARINES
HAVE BEEN ASSISTING THE LOCAL PLANETARY FORCES TO KEEP KEY AREAS ON
PLANET SECURE FROM THESE TERRORISTS , WHO WERE ATTACKING AREAS AT
RANDOM WITH LITTLE SUCCESS . THE U.W. COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND
IT'S GRATITUDE TO THE C.M.C. FOR IT'S SPEEDY RESPONSE TO DEVELOPMENTS
DURING THIS INCIDENT . AN EXPANDED C.M.C. PRESENCE WILL REMAIN ON
PLANET FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS TO SECURE ANY MISSED TERRORISTS .

 THIS REPORTER CAN CONFIRM THAT C.M.C. FORCES HAVE STARTED TO WITHDRAW
. HOWEVER IF THE REPORT ABOUT THE ESCAPING SHUTTLES ARE TRUE THEN
MORE MUST BE DONE TO APPREHEND THESE PEOPLE , PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE
BLOOD OF 286 MARINES ON THEIR HANDS   .  - K.ADIE XRDS 329 M M

STATED THAT THE PLANET WERE THIS DISEASE WAS FOUND WILL BE HAZARDOUS
BUT AS THIS PLANET IS NO LONGER A MEMBER OF THE U.W. CONTACT WITH

 . THEIR CO. STATED THAT LEAVE HAD BEEN ALLOWED AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE
MOMENT  ' TO IMPROVE MORALE AMONG THE MARINES ' . OUR REPORTER WENT
