WELCOME TO OUR DECEMBER EDITION OF IN THE LINE OF FIRE . OUR ABSENCE
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTH'S WAS DUE TO EDITORIAL STAFF BEING ABSENT
DUE TO THE INCIDENT ON CROSSROADS 329 . THE STAFF HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED
WITH NEW PERSONNEL AND HERE WE ARE . FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS A
REPORT FROM OUR REPORTER ON CROSSROADS 329 :-

  ' WELL THE SITUATION FROM CROSSROADS IS LOOKING GRIM  , THIS REPORT
WAS SMUGGLED OFF PLANET IN A MEDIVAC SHUTTLE DUE TO A PRESS BLACKOUT
, ORDERED BY GEN. A. PERIGEES TWO MONTHS AGO .

   SINCE JULY FOURTEEN COMPANIES OF FRONT LINE C.M.C. UNITS HAVE ARRIVED
ON PLANET , ALONG WITH TWENTY COMPANIES OF RESERVE C.M.C. UNITS .

  THESE UNITS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST WELL DISCIPLINED AND WELL
TRAINED TERRORISTS IN AN ALL OUT WAR THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD LAST
SEVERAL MONTHS YET .

  C.M.C. COMMAND ARE SAYING THAT THE FIGHTING WILL BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS
, BUT GROUND TROOPS ARE COMPLAINING OF HAVING JUST TOO MUCH GROUND
TO COVER IN NOT ENOUGH TIME TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT THE TERRORIST INCURSIONS
. I THINK THIS WAR MAY BE UN-WINABLE THE WAY THAT COMMAND ARE FIGHTING
IT . SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE  I HAVE NOT YET SEEN A SPECIAL FORCES
UNIT OR ANY TYPE OF PREMIERE FIGHTING UNIT ARRIVE ON PLANET .

 THE TROOPS HERE ARE ASKING ABOUT THIS  ' RAPID REACTION FORCE'

 AND IS IT BIG ENOUGH TO GET THEM OUT OF THE S**T THAT 3coy HAVE LEFT
FOR THEM TO SORT OUT .  MOST OF 3coy WERE MEDIVAC'ED OFF PLANET  BUT
SEVERAL ARE POSTED AS MISSING IN ACTION AND THERE IS A SMALL CONTINGENT
ON  PLANET .

 A HUGE NAVAL BLOCKADE IS IN PLACE AROUND THE PLANET INCLUDING SIX
FRIGATES , TWO CRUISERS AND A TYPE FOUR BATTLESHIP . DESPITE THIS
SEVERAL SHUTTLES ARE SAID TO HAVE RUN THE BLOCKADE  AND GOT THROUGH
.

 THERE IS A RUMOUR THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO TERRORIST TRAINING
CAMPS ON PLANET  AND IT WAS ONE OF THESE THAT 3coy  ' UPSET ' WITH
A PATROL  THAT PASSED A BIT TOO CLOSE FOR THE TERRORISTS LIKING AND
THINGS ESCALATED FROM THERE .

 CURRENT CASUALTY FIGURES ARE UNAVAILABLE BUT WITH THE TERRORISTS
USING HIT AND RUN TACTICS AGAINST FIRE BASES THESE FIGURES ARE BOUND
TO RISE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS .

 MORALE AMONGST THE TROOPS HERE IS BOUND TO TUMBLE WHEN THEY FIND
OUT THAT THEY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE HERE FOR CHRISTMAS . BUT THE
ATTACKS ARE ALSO STARTING TO SUBSIDE , PROBABLY DUE TO THE TERRORISTS
HAVING BEEN ON THE MOVE NOW FOR ALMOST FOUR MONTHS . I PERSONALLY
DON'T HOLD OUT HOPE TO ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT THEY WILL BE HOME FOR
CHRISTMAS . AND I AM SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO IS HOME BY CHRISTMAS AS
THEY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE GOING HOME IN A BODY BAG .

THE U.W. HAS MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ABOUT THE SITUATION ON CROSSROADS
329 .

IN JULY THE AREA AROUND CROSSROADS 329 WAS DECLARED OFF-LIMITS TO
ALL NON MILITARY CRAFT FOLLOWING A MAJOR MILITARY DISTURBANCE .

THE SITUATION HAS NOT YET CALMED ENOUGH FOR THESE RESTRICTIONS TO
BE LIFTED .

THE RUMOUR THAT THE RAPID REACTION FORCE IS PLANET-BOUND IS COMPLETELY
UNFOUNDED AS THIS IS A MATTER OF CIVIL UNREST AND OF SMALL SCALE MILITARY
INCURSIONS - NOT A MATTER FOR THE RAPID REACTION FORCE TO BE CALLED
UPON TO DEAL WITH .

THE U.W. IS NOT YET IN A POSITION TO CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THE C.M.C.
HAVE TAKEN ANY CASUALTIES.

### RECOVERED 

 5 coy LAST MONTH RECOVERED A QUANTITY OF BODDENITE  OFF OF C.M.C.
SPECIAL FORCES WHO , IT IS BELIEVED HAD TURNED ROGUE . COMMAND HAVE
NOT YET COMMENTED ON THIS  ' FIND ' BUT IT DID APPARENTLY COME FROM
THE SAME BATCH AS THE QUANTITY THAT WAS STOLEN FROM  PHOLAX 3 , ALLEGEDLY
BY MASTER SGT. GIBSON OF 5 coy SPECIAL FORCES WHO ALONG WITH THE BODDENITE
, HAS BEEN MISSING AND WANTED FOR QUESTIONING SINCE 2494 .

### INQUIRY OVER

THE INQUIRY INTO THE MARIE CELESTE DISASTER IS NOT OVER . THE REPORT
IS DUE OUT LATER THIS MONTH , AND WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS IN NEXT
MONTHS EDITION OF IN THE LINE OF FIRE .

### SPECIAL FORCES  HYGIENE NO 15 RAPID REACTION FORCE 

##### PEST CONTROL .
_OR IN MARINE TERMS HOW TO KILL A RAT_

RATS PRESENT A SPECIAL PROBLEM  THERE I.R. IMMUNE , RESISTANT TO POISONS
( UNLESS YOU DROWN THEM IN IT ) ,AND SINCE THE BAN ON PROJECTILE WEAPONS
THE OLD G6 10mm APHE ASSAULT CHAIN GUN IS TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION
. SO HOW DO YOU KILL A RAT ?

 1) RAT TRAP 

NOT THE RECOMMENDED METHOD AS MOST RAT TRAPS ARE DESIGNED BY WEAK
STOMACHED  CIVVIES WHO ARE ' ECO-FRIENDLY '  OR HUMANE OR WHO THINK
RAT ARE CUTE FURRY ANIMALS AND SO DON'T DESIGN TRAPS THAT CONVERT
THEM INTO INTERESTING LITTLE RED MESSES ON THE WALL LIKE THE GOOD
OLD SHOTGUN USED TO DO .

 2) LANDMINE

EXCELLENT METHOD WITH A HINT OF DANGER , FIRST PAINT THE LANDMINE
YELLOW ADD A BIT OF CHEESE , STAND BACK AND BINGO ! INSTANT TOASTED
RAT  . GREAT ENTERTAINMENT VALUE FOR THE KIDS AND GREAT TO LIVEN UP
EVEN THE WORST BARBECUE .

IMPORTANT  REMEMBER TO BAIT THE MINE BEFORE ARMING IT OTHERWISE LOSS
OF HEARING , SIGHT , FINGERS , ARMS OR LEGS MAY RESULT .

 3) AMBUSH 

THE OLD METHOD IS ALWAYS THE BEST SO GRAB YOUR GILLIE SUIT AND WAIT
THE CUNNING LITTLE SODS OUT , NOW SOME OF YOU WITH THE OLD HYGIENE
MANUAL WILL RECOGNISE THIS AS THE OLD METHOD 2 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE
OLD 200mmTOW TYPE 4 ANTI TANK MISSILE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN , SO THE
BEST BET IS THE GRENADE , THE 

:::

:::

::: column-left

 FLAME-THROWER OR REMOTE DET APD . NOTE MOST CIVVIE INSURANCE COMPANIES
WILL NOT COVER CLAIMS FOR SUBSIDENCE OR FIRE AS A RESULT OF USING
THIS TECHNIQUE .

 4) INFILTRATION

THIS IS THE WAY TO MAKE SURE OF GETTING THE JOB DONE , NOT AS FUN
AS METHOD 3 , BUT IT'S A LOT MORE  PERSONAL . THE AVERAGE RAT IS QUICK
AND STEALTHY , WHAT WITH ALL THOSE APD'S  , LANDMINES AND FLAME-THROWERS
ABOUT YOU'D BETTER BE CAREFUL . SO YOUR BEST BET IS TO OUTWIT HIM
( IF THAT'S POSSIBLE FOR A MARINE TO DO - ED ) .FIRST GET A RAT SUIT
AND STUDY THEM , AS PER COVERT OPPS PROCEDURES , THEN INFILTRATE HIS
NEST .ONCE YOU'VE GOT HIS CONFIDENCE STICK HIM WITH THE OLD Mk2a COMBAT
KNIFE , THEY'RE BE NO RUNNING OFF IN THE SMOKE AND DUST THIS TIME
, OH NO , RAT KEBAB FOR CERTAIN THIS TIME ! .

NOTE ..... MOST RATS ARE ABOUT 8-12 INCHES LONG , IF YOUR NOT SURE
FIND A DEAD ONE AND MEASURE IT IF IT'S ABOUT 2-3 FEET LONG THEN YOU
PROBABLY GOT NEXTDOOR'S PIT BULL BY MISTAKE , SERVES THE LITTLE BASTARD
RIGHT FOR PISSING ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE DISGUISED AS A TREE STAKING
OUT No 6 WHEN YOU WERE AFTER THE SQIRREL LAST WEEK .IF YOUR ' RAT
' IS REALLY BIG , LIKE SIX FEET BIG , THEN YOU'VE PROBABLY TAKEN OUT
A FRIENDLY , SO DITCH THE BODY IN A DITCH AND HOPE NOBODY MISSES HIM
, IF YOU GET STUCK THEN TALK TO V COY , APPARENTLY THEY'VE HAD LOTS
OF EXPERIENCE OF THIS RECENTLY .

 5) NUKE THE BASTARD !

 NO BLOODY WAY HE IS GOING TO GET AWAY THIS TIME ! . IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO BE SURE .

:::

::: column-right
 TAKE OFF IN YOUR SHUTTLE AND NUKE THE ENTIRE SITE FROM ORBIT !

 NOTE :- IF YOU OPT FOR THIS METHOD TO GET RID OF THE RAT MAKE SURE
YOU MOVE HOUSE FIRST , WHAT WITH ALL THOSE CRATERS , SCORCH MARKS
, AND BODIES LAYING EVERYWHERE IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO GO ANYWHERE AND
DECONTAMINATION BILLS ARE TOTALLY UNREAL .

ALL QUERIES ARE TO BE SENT TO OUR NEW ADDRESS ON ALPHA PROXIMA AS
OUT TRAINING BASE ON GROOMBRIDGE HAS NOW BEEN ABANDONED DUE TO AN
INFESTATION OF RATS .

### LETTERS 

 A LETTER WAS RECEIVED THE OTHER DAY REGARDING THE G2'S TWO DROPSHIPS
, WITCH HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN RENAMED ILLEGALLY AND THE MTC. CREW THAT
FOUND THE MODIFICATIONS WERE SO TAKEN IN BY IT THAT THEY CONTACTED
THE TOP BRASS AT C.M.C. HQ TO CONFIRM IF THE TWO NAMES WERE GENUINE
OR NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE SO WELL DONE USING OFFICIAL STENCILS .NOW
DROPSHIP #1 GILLHAM AND DROPSHIP #2 HARRIS SHOULD BE REPAINTED IF
THE BOOK IS FOLLOWED , BUT PERSONALLY I WOULD BE PROUD TO SERVE ONCE
MORE ALONGSIDE TWO OF V COY'S MAJORS WHO DIED IN ACTION AND I THINK
THAT THESE ' ILLEGAL ' MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE MADE PERMANENT AND
ALSO EVEN STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE , IT SEEMS RIGHT THAT MARINES
ARE REMINDED OF MEN WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES SERVING THE CORPS , I THINK
THAT IT WOULD RAISE MORALE AND I URGE WHOEVER AT FLEET MAKES THIS
DECISION , PLEASE MAKE THIS OFFICIAL . I ALSO URGE THE PERSON WHO
MADE THESE MODIFICATIONS :- NEXT TIME YOU HAVE AN IDEA - GO THROUGH
OFFICIAL PROCEDURES      __CORP. D. DIBBLEY V COY.__

### SPECIAL FORCES  TACTICS No 7 - HOW TO BUILD A FOX HOLE 

 A FOXHOLE IS VERY EFFECTIVE WHEN DEFENDING A POSITION FROM CRAP CRACK
OPPOSITION IN AN OPEN ENVIRONMENT .

IT HAS SEVERAL VERY EFFECTIVE ADVANTAGES NAMELY :-

1. YOU CAN HIDE FROM THE ENEMY .
2. YOU CAN SEE THE ENEMY WHEN POSSIBLY THEY CAN'T SEE YOU , BUT
DON'T BET ON IT .
3. ITS BETTER THAN A TENT WHEN IT'S COLD , EXCEPT THEY ARE ALMOST
ALWAYS WET IN THE BOTTOM

##### CONSTRUCTION

 BASICALLY ITS A HOLE IN THE GROUND , SO IT'S DOWN TO A SHOVEL AND
SOME HARD GRAFT OR IF YOUR A LAZY BUGGER LIKE MOST MARINES THE EXPLOSIVE
RECIPE IS 1 oz OF EXPLOSIVE PER MAN .

IF YOU ARE MAKING A COMMAND TRENCH THEN 2 kg SHOULD DO IT , BUT WATCH
OUT FOR THE DEBRIS THAT THIS THROWS OUT AND STAND WELL BACK .

IF YOU HAVE HAD A RODENT PROBLEM THEN MOST OF THOSE METHODS HAVE ALREADY
CONSTRUCTED ONE FOR YOU , IF YOU USED METHOD 5 THEN DON'T FORGET THE
N.B.C. SUIT 

   _HAPPY COLD WET MISERABLE NIGHTS MARINES ._
