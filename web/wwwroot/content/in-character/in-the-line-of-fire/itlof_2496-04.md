### NASCO DEAD !

 THE U.W. 'S MOST WANTED MAN FOR OVER THREE YEARS IS DEAD . FORMER
COLONEL NASCO OF V COY  WAS KILLED DURING AN OPERATION ON SIRRUS BY
V COY . COLONEL NASCO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATROCITIES ON ALTAIR
IV WHERE MARINES UNDER HIS COMMAND , UNKNOWINGLY , INTRODUCED  A PLAGUE
ONTO THE PLANET . THE PLAGUE HAD A DISASTROUS TOLL ON THE LOCAL POPULATION
AND EVEN NOW , OVER FOUR YEARS LATER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS VERY
DISTRUSTFUL OF THE C.M.C. .

 COL. NASCO WAS SENSATIONALLY CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES AMONGST FEARS
OF WITNESSES BEING BOUGHT OFF AND THREATS BEING MADE , INDEED THE
JUDGE WAS INVOLVED IN A LINER ' ACCIDENT ' WERE ALL PERSONNEL ON BOARD
WERE KILLED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIAL .

 OTHER CHARGES WERE PLACED AGAINST NASCO AFTER HE ' LEFT A CALLING
CARD ' WITH V COY THREE YEARS AGO IN THE FORM OF A DEAD MARINE , KILLED
BY A PROJECTILE WEAPON . HE WAS THEN CHARGED WITH MURDER , HANDLING
A PROJECTILE WEAPON , USE OF A PROJECTILE WEAPON AND A WARRANT WAS
ISSUED FOR HIS ARREST . SINCE THEN VERY LITTLE OF HIM HAS BEEN SEEN
, ALTHOUGH THE C.M.C. HAVE FOUND ACTIVITIES THAT HE WAS SUSPECTED
OF  HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN BUT HE WAS NEVER FOUND AT THE TIME .

 C.M.C. H.Q. HAVE CONFIRMED THAT NASCO IS DEAD BUT HAVE , INTERESTINGLY
, NOTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS UNKNOWN . I.T.L.O.F. WISH TO CONGRATULATE
V COY ON A JOB WELL DONE .

### NAVAL THREAT

WHILE V COY WERE ON SIRRUS THE G 2 WAS FORCED TO LEAVE GEO-STATIONARY
ORBIT BY SEVEN UNKNOWN , BUT PROBABLY CORPORATE SHIPS , ENTERING THE
AREA . THE COLONIAL NAVY HAVE REFUSED TO IDENTIFY WERE THESE SHIPS
APPEARED FROM AND IF THEY WERE ARMED OR NOT . MOST OF THE COLONIAL
FLEET , RETURNING FROM CROSSROADS 329 HAVE BEEN DIVERTED THERE AND
A NAVAL SPOKESMAN HAS REPORTED THAT THE NAVY ARE , IF NECESSARY PREPARED
TO KICK SOME ASS TO STABILISE THE SITUATION .

### CORPORATE TAKEOVER

 SIRRUS'S PLANETARY GOVERNMENT HAS APPARENTLY SOLD THE PLANET TO A
CORPORATE COALITION , BELIEVED TO INCLUDE DEWITTE MINING AND ANOTHER
UNKNOWN CORPORATION .

 THERE IS A RUMOUR CIRCULATING AT THE MOMENT THAT THESE TWO , OR MORE
CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO USE THIS PLANET TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE
U.W. . THE C.M.C. HAVE REFUSED TO CONFIRM  OR DENY THIS RUMOUR .

 THE C.M.C. DID HOWEVER STATE THAT THEY ARE EXAMINING THE SITUATION
VERY CLOSELY AND WILL DEAL WITH ANY THREATS THAT DEVELOP ' WITH ENOUGH
FORCE TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT , OR ANY THAT MAY DEVELOP  IN THE FUTURE
' .

 WE WISH THE NAVAL UNITS EN-ROUTE TO SIRRUS GOOD LUCK AND GOD SPEED

### V COY - CASUALTIES

 TWO MARINES HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES ON SIRRUS MARINE WOW-WOW , AND
ACTING SGT MARTINS , BOTH OF V COY .

 MARINE WOW-WOW HAD SERVED IN V COY FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME BUT WAS WELL LIKED AND WILL BE MISSED . HE DIED FROM A LOCALISED
ATMOSPHERIC ABNORMALITY .

 SGT MARTINS HAD SERVED IN V COY FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS AND WAS DUE
, IN JULY , TO BE RETURNED TO KRUGER AFTER THE COMPLETION OF A COMBAT
ROTATION LASTING FIVE YEARS . HE JOINED V COY IN 2491 ON COLONEL NASCO
AND MAJOR ASH'S INVITATION AFTER BEING SPOTTED ON EXERCISE WITH THE
KRUGAN MILITIA . LT. TURNER , HIS ACTING C.O. SAID THAT MARTINS ALMOST
SEEMED TO HAVE A DEATHWISH WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT NASCO WAS ON PLANET
AND THAT HE HAD LOST A GOOD FRIEND WHEN NASCO HAD SHOT HIM , WITH
A PROJECTILE WEAPON , AS SGT. MARTINS , MARINE DOE , LT. TURNER AND
LT. DE LIMA HAD TAKEN NASCO DOWN WITH I.R. WEAPONS AT THE TIME NASCO
WAS ATTEMPTING TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE . I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DIED BUT
HE DID HAVE A KNIFE WOUND FROM THE TIME THAT CAP. CALVIN STABBED HIM
WHEN WE AMBUSHED HIM .

 MAJOR MARTINS K.C.C. OF THE KRUGAN MILITIA WILL BE LAID TO REST AT
THE END OF THE MONTH ON KRUGER .

 MEDICAL-SGT. DIBBLEY WILL ALSO BE TRANSFERRED AFTER A REQUEST WAS
 RECEIVED BY H.Q. . IT IS UNKNOWN WHY DIBBLEY WANTS TO LEAVE V COY
 BUT IT IS RUMOURED THAT HE HAS HIS REASONS ALTHOUGH ANOTHER RUMOUR
STATES IT IS NOT THROUGH CHOICE .

### IDIOTS  MARINES GUIDE TO SHIPBOARD LIFE 

1. DON'T OPEN ANY WINDOWS , THIS MAY RESULT IN A SLIGHT DECOMPRESSION
IN THE ROOM FOLLOWED BY A LOSS OF BREATHABLE AIR .
2. DON'T MESS ABOUT WITH THE EEV CONTROLS , LOSS OF EEV'S IS BOTH
EXPENSIVE AND KINDA AWKWARD WHEN YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE SHIP IN A HURRY
.
3. DON'T INSULT THE COOK'S FOOD , C-RATIONS ARE OK IN COMBAT , BUT
YOU CAN GET SICK TO DEATH OF THEM AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS OF ONLY EATING
C-RATIONS .
4. DON'T GO OUTSIDE FOR A FAG , UNLESS YOU FIRST PUT ON AN ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION SUIT .
5. WHILE TRAINING , REMEMBER THAT THE ONLY EXPLOSIVES SAFE TO USE
ONBOARD SHIP ARE DUMMY CHARGES ( THE ONES WITH THE GREEN STRIPE IN
THE GREEN BOXES ) . THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT USING DUMMY CHARGES ARE
A PILE OF PAPER-WORK ABOUT A METER THICK , AND LOSS OF ARM'S , LEGS
, BLOOD ETC. .
6. IF THE EVACUATE SIGNAL IS HEARD , CHECK IF IT IS A DRILL , IF
IT IS THEN DON'T ENABLE THE EEV'S , IF IS IS NOT A DRILL THEN USE
THE EEV'S AS SOON AS THEY ARE FULL .
7. WHEN EXITING TO GO TO THE HANGER DECK ON LARGE SHIPS CAN BE EMBARRASSING
IF YOU GO TO THE WRONG HANGER , ROLLING A SQUAD OF MARINES THROUGH
THE HANGER AS A DROPSHIP EXITS THROUGH THE DROP BAY CAN GET MESSY
, SNOWBALLING DOWN AFTER THE DROPSHIP WITHOUT A SNOWBALL POD LACKS
THE ATMOSPHERE OF GOING DOWN IN A DROPSHIP , IF YOU GET MY MEANING
.
