### CROSSROADS 329     -    MASSACRE

  III COY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED ON CROSSROADS 329  REPORTS INDICATE THAT
III COY HAVE TAKEN CASUALTY RATES OF UP TO 30 % FATALITIES AND 60%
W.I.A. 

 THE C.M.C. AREA  COMMANDER , GEN. A. PERIGEES HAS DECLARED THE PLANET
OFF-LIMITS TO ALL NON MILITARY TRANSPORTS AND THE U.W. COUNCIL HAVE
DECLARED A PLANET-WIDE  STATE OF EMERGENCY  A NUMBER OF RESERVE C.M.C.
UNITS ARE  PLANETBOUND AND  IT IS BELIEVED THAT BOTH L.A.W. AND THE
BROTHERHOOD HAVE MAJOR BASES ON PLANET AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT TROUBLE
STARTED WHEN AN O.P. WAS ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLED UPON BY A BROTHERHOOD
PATROL ( OR THE MARINES GOT TRIGGER HAPPY , I THINK WE ALL KNOW WITCH
IT WAS DON'T WE PEOPLE ) .

TROUBLE THEN APPARENTLY SPREAD VERY FAST AND WITHIN SIX HOURS III
COY HAD LOST FOUR FIREBASE'S , ONE OF WITCH WAS LOST WITH ALL PERSONNEL
K.I.A. OR W.I.A. .

III COY CAME CLOSE TO LOSING FOXTROT-FIVE   - THE MAIN SPACE PORT
ON PLANET , BUT FOR TWO DROPSHIPS OF OUT BOUND MARINES WHO TURNED
BACK .

A III COY SPOKESPERSON SAID THAT THE ATTACK AGAINST THEM WAS EXTREMELY
WELL PLANNED AND EXECUTED , BUT MARINES ON THE GROUND REPORTED COCKUPS
ON A GRAND SCALE INCLUDING:- 

1. A DROPSHIPS FULL OF RELIEF TROOPS WITCH LANDED IN A MINEFIELD 
2. RELIEF TROOPS BEING LANDED ON CO-ORDINATES MARKED AS BEING 'HOT
AREAS '

3.  KEY PERSONNEL ON R & R AT THE TIME OF ATTACK .
4. SUPPORT UNITS BEING UP TO SIX HOURS FLIGHT TIME AWAY FROM UNITS
THAT THEY WERE SUPPORTING.

WE HAVE A REPORTER IN FOXTROT-FIVE WHO SENT US THE FOLLOWING REPORT
::-

 THE SCENE HERE IS THAT OF UTTER CHAOS , THE FIREBASE'S GUARDING THE
SPACE PORT ARE JUST ABOUT HOLDING ON , THE TARMAC OUT HERE IS LITTERED
WITH BODIES ON STRETCHERS AND THERE ARE MEDIVAC SHUTTLES LEAVING ABOUT
ONCE EVERY MINUTE OR SO .

I HAVE ALSO SEEN WOUNDS WITCH COULD HAVE ONLY BEEN CAUSED BY PROJECTILE
WEAPONS , ALTHOUGH THE MARINES ARE SAYING THEY WERE CAUSED BY A SHUTTLE
LANDING IN A MINE FIELD .

RELIEF TROOPS ARE STARTING TO ARRIVE BUT I THINK THEY WILL BE TOO
LATE FOR MOST OF III COY WHO  WILL BE IN A WORSE STATE THAN US AT
MANY OF THE O.P.'S  AND FIREBASE'S IN THE ' STICKS ' ( OUT OF TOWN
AREAS - ED ) .

 WHEN THE ATTACKS STARTED THE SUPPORT TEAMS WERE QUITE SIMPLY BOGGED
DOWN WITH REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT -  TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN WERE LOGGED
IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS  BUT SINCE THEN FOUR FIREBASE'S AND COUNTLESS
O.P.'S HAVE BEEN  ABANDONED AND NOW THE SUPPORT TEAMS ARE STRETCHED
, BUT COPING ( JUST ! ).

  CPL. K. ADIE , IN THE LINE OF FIRE , 
  FOXTROT-FIVE , CROSSROADS 329 .

  WE WILL OBVIOUSLY GET MORE NEWS FROM CROSSROADS 329 AS IT BECOMES
AVAILABLE - ED.
