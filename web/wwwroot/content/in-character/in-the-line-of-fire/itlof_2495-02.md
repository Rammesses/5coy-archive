WELL HERE WE ARE AGAIN FOR THE SECOND EDITION AND I HAVE GIVEN THE
MAIL BAG TO SGT B'STARD AND I AM SURE WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM SOON .

BY THE WAY HAVE ANY MARINES SEEN THE 135TH KRUGAN MIL. AROUND BECAUSE
 'FLASH ' BANNISTER , ONE OF OUR REPORTERS IS WITH THEM , AND I DONT
KNOW WERE THEY ARE, SEE ALL I'VE HAD FROM HIM SINCE GROOMBRIDGE IS
BLOODY MERC STORIES TO PASS ON TO INTER STELLER SO IF ANY ONE CAN
CONTACT HIM TELL HIM TO GET HIS BUTT BACK TO H.Q.

### TRAINING INCIDENTS

SEVERAL 5COY NCO'S HAVE BEEN REPRIMANDED FOLLOWING AN INCIDENT IN
DECEMBER DURING A TRAINING EXERCISE HOWEVER COMMAND  CANNOT CONFIRM
WERE THEY WERE IN DECEMBER 2494 OUR OWN ENQUIRIES SHOW THAT THE GARAVIGLIA
II  WAS NOT NEAR ANY PERMANENT TRAINING FACILITIES. SO DO ANY OF 5COY
KNOW WHERE THEY WERE OR WHERE  THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN?    

WELL BACK TO THE FRONT LINE AND THIS MONTH:-

* 1ST COY DID GUARD DUTY DURING THE UW ANNUAL CONFERANCE, HELD IN GENEVA


* 2 COY CONFISCATED 500 ILLEGAL CMC TYPE DRUG CANNISTERS WITH BROKEN SEALS

* 3 COY ARE BEING MOVED BACK TO TERRA FOR SOME R&R AFTER BEING ON CROSSROADS
329 FOR THREE MONTHS SOLID

* 4 COY ARE STILL MISSING FROM THEIR BASESHIP AND COULD BE ALMOST ANY
WERE

* 5 COY LOST ( ALLEGEDLY QUITE LITERALLY ) CAP. ZWARF AND AN UNNAMED
MARINE,  AND THE CMC ARE NOT RELEASING ANY FURTHER DETAILS  AT PRESENT.

WE HAVE HAD AN ANONYMOUS LETTER ARRIVE THAT IS VERY CRITICAL OF CMC
TRAINING TECHNIQUES.   APPARENTLY A COMPANY OF MARINES TOOK PART IN
AN EXERCISE TO LOCATE A DOWNED SHUTTLE.  THEIR MISSION OBJECTIVE WAS
TO LOCATE ANY SURVIVING CREW OR PASSENGERS , AND TO RETRIVE THE BLACK
BOX FLIGHT RECORDER .

WELL YOU MIGHT ALL SAY  THAT IS NOT THAT HARD IS IT? BUT SUPPOSING
YOU THEN THEN ASK WHAT DOES THIS BLACK BOX LOOK LIKE? HOW MANY CREW
AND PASSENGERS ARE THEIR? AND ALL YOU GET IS A BLANK LOOK FROM YOUR
C.O. 

SO IT IS NOT THAT SURPRISING THAT THIS GROUP OF MARINES WENT OFF AND
SCREWED UP BIG TIME WHEN THEY HAD THIS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION MISSING
FROM THEIR BRIEF WAS IT? AND ASK YOURSELF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IN A LIVE MISSION IF YOU WERE ON A SEARCH AND RETRIEVE MISSION AND
YOU DIDDENT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR, WOULD YOU SCREW UP? PROBABALLY
 IF INTELLIGENCE IS THAT BAD .

### LETTERS
_REPLYS BY SGT. I.D.E.B'STARD_ 

DEAR SIR,  I WRITE TO YOUR PUBLICATION
ABOUT THE UNJUST COMMENT ABOUT 2 COYS XMAS PARTY . IN YOUR REPORT
IT STATED THAT IT WAS HELD IN THE LONDON MILLITARY PRISON DUE TO THE
HIGH 2 COY PRESENCE. THIS OF COURSE WOULD BE TRUE DUE TO THE  COINCIDENCE
THAT 2 COY WERE ACTUALLY GUARDING SAID ESTABLISHMENT , AND I FEEL
THAT THE FACT THAT 2 COY WERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE "WALLS" WAS NOT
PUT OVER IN THIS REPORT.                 

I HOPE YOU COULD HELP ENSURE THAT THIS
IS MADE CLEAR IN FUTURE EDITIONS OF YOU PUBLICATION.             

MAJ. J.P.LLOYD-FRANCIS-WALKER-SMITH-BOYDEN-BROWN,
C.O. 2 COY
