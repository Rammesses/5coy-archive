 WELL ANOTHER YEAR IS WITH US NOW , AND HQ HAD THE FOLLOWING TO SAY
:-

  CONGRATULATIONS TO V COY FOR IMPROVING THEIR RECORD , DESPITE HAVING
TO FILL IN WHEN SPECIAL FORCES  WERE PULLED OUT OF THE FIELD AND DESPITE
PRESS REPORTS TO THE CONTRARY THEY ONLY LEFT 47 BODIES ON HAL , NOT
OVER 50 AS WAS REPORTED IN ANOTHER PUBLICATION.

 III COY HAVE  MANAGED TO START A PLANETARY WAR COMPLETELY UNAIDED
, SO I WILL GIVE THEM ALL THE CREDIT AS THIS TAKES SOME DOING , EVEN
BY V COY STANDARDS AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE OF THIS IN
THE PAST .

 II COY HAVE DONE NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY THIS YEAR EXCEPT THAT THEIR
REGIMENTAL DINNER WAS SUPERB AND I GUARANTEE I WILL NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT IT NEXT YEAR EITHER.

 I COY HAVE HAD A VERY HARD YEAR WITH A RECORD NUMBER OF OFFICIAL
FUNCTIONS , AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE QUITE SO BUSY NEXT YEAR
AS THEY STILL HAVE ALL THEIR LEAVE TO USE UP , AND THEY WILL LOSE
IT IF THEY DON'T USE IT BY THE END OF MARCH .

 WELL TO ROUND UP '95 , THE C.M.C. HAD QUITE A GOOD YEAR WITH NOT
TOO MANY DISASTERS AND I HOPE THAT '96 IS THE SAME . HAPPY NEW YEAR
FROM H.Q. 

### NEW C.O. APPOINTED .

 MAJOR ZWARF HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN APPOINTED AS THE NEW C.O. OF V AND
IV COY'S AND I.T.L.O.F. WISHES HIM GOOD LUCK IN THIS POST , AS BOTH
HIS PREDECESSORS HAVEN'T LASTED VERY LONG .

CPL. ADIE HAS COME ACROSS THE FOLLOWING LETTER - SENT BY ACTING CPL.
LUCIFER SHORTLY BEFORE HIS SQUAD WAS MEDIVAC'ED OUT IN JULY :-

 OUR SQUAD HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN A TWO WEEK OB'S JOB SO THIS IS A QUICKIE
BEFORE WE GO  SORRY THE INKS RUN BUT THESE B****Y BIVIES ARE ABOUT
AS MUCH USE AS A SIEVE IN A SHOWER AND AS WE'VE GOT A 25KM TAB IN
THE MORNING WERE TRYING TO GET OUR HEADS DOWN .

 SGT. MAKEPEACE AND CPL. T'CHING HAVE GOT THE S***'S SOMETHING TERRIBLE
AND AS THE SQUAD WON'T GO WITHIN 30 FT OF THEM I'VE BEEN MADE ACTING
CPL. AND AM TAKING THE SQUAD OUT ON THIS OP , THE CAPTAIN DID MUTTER
SOMETHING ABOUT ' NO EXPERIENCE OF COMMAND SITUATION'S ' AND ' AGAINST
HIS BETTER JUDGEMENT ' BUT I THOUGHT ' BEST OF A BAD LOT ' WAS THE
MOST PROMISING REMARK THAT HE MADE .

 WELL I FOR ONE WILL BE GLAD TO GET OUT OF THIS BASE , SEE I THINK
WERE BEING WATCHED BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT . HEY I MEAN I CAN SEE A COMPROMISED
BASE WHEN I SEE ONE , AND I SEE ONE HERE NOW BUT THE CAPTAIN WON'T
BELIEVE ME  BECAUSE I ' HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH EXPERIENCE OF  TACTICAL
SITUATIONS ' MY RESPONSE TO THIS IS ' HOW FAST CAN WE TAB 25 KM LADS
' .

WHEN THE O.P.'S IS OVER .

 CPL. LUCIFER'S SQUAD WERE THE ONLY SURVIVORS FROM THE AREA OF THE
FIRST ATTACK AND ARE NOW ONBOARD THE MED-SHIP AND WILL BE FIT FOR

### KRUGAN BASE TO CLOSE

  THE KRUGAN MILITIA HAVE MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ON THE FATE
OF THE CHARL V BASE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF VILLHAMSTEAD :- 

 THE CHARL V BASE HAS BEEN USED BY THE KRUGAN MILITIA SINCE THE PLANET
WAS FIRST COLONISED INDEED IT WAS THE FIRST MILITARY OUTPOST TO BE
SET-UP AFTER COLONISATION  AND IT DID NOT FALL DURING THE COLONIAL
WARS , IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT THIS BASE SHOULD CLOSE BUT THE
TOWN THAT GREW ROUND IT NOW CONSTRICTS IT'S GROWTH AND SO THE KRUGAN
MILITIA HAVE DECIDED THAT AS OF THE END OF JANUARY 2496 THE BASE WILL
CLOSE . ALL PERSONNEL FROM THIS BASE WILL BE ABSORBED INTO OTHER BASES
IN THE AREA BUT MAINLY INTO THE BASE AT NEW BURNHAM  WERE THE MERCENARY
TRAINING PROGRAM WILL RELOCATE TO .

 IN THE BEGINNING .....

  THERE WAS LEMMING SQUAD 

  THEN CAME DELTA SQUAD .....

   AND NOW A NEW BUNCH OF NUTTERS GRACE THE G 2 ......
