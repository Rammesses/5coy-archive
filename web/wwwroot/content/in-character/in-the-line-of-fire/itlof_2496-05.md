### PARNELL RESCUED BY V COY

 LAST MONTH V COY RESCUED VANESSA PARNELL AFTER SHE HAD BEEN CAPTURED
WHILST VISITING A PARNELL RESEARCH FACILITY . V COY REPORTED MANY
PROBLEMS IN RESCUING HER DUE TO SECURITY  SYSTEMS ON THE FACILITY
AND THOSE WHICH THE TERRORISTS HAD SETUP THEMSELVES .

   THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE KNOCKOUT GAS , WHICH CAUSED A LET OF CIVILIAN
CASUALTIES AND THE NEWLY APPOINTED C.M.O. OF V COY , SPEC 2 PETERSON
AND HIS MEDICAL TEAM WERE STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT SEVERAL TIMES DURING
THE OPERATION . 

 V COY TOOK VERY HEAVY CASUALTIES DURING THE OPERATION AND LOST A
CIVILIAN ADVISOR , MR. CYBERKNIGHT WHO WAS CAPTURED BY THE TERRORISTS
, HE HAD ALREADY SAVED A LARGE GROUP OF CIVILIANS WHO WORSHIPPED HIM
AS THE REINCARNATION OF ARNOLD SCHWARTZENIGGER . HE WILL BE MISSED
BY V COY WHOM HE HAS SERVED ON AND OFF WITH FOR SEVERAL YEARS , AND
V COY HAD RECENTLY RECOVERED HIM ON A PREVIOUS OPERATION AFTER HE
' GOT  UPSET AND PACKED HIMSELF UP IN A STORAGE CRATE ' AND WAS THEN
FORGOTTEN WHEN THE BASE WAS EVACUATED ON HAL .

 AN EXPERIMENTAL NEW TREATMENT PROCESS WAS ALSO USED BY THE COMPANY
ON THIS OPERATION , CALLED NERVE RE-ALIGNMENT IT IS USED TO ' RESET
' THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AFTER OVER EXPOSURE TO I.R. WITHOUT THE NEED
FOR SURGERY.

 THIS PROCESS, UNDER TESTING AT THE RESEARCH FACILITY IS STILL A LONG
WAY FROM FIELD USE AND IS UNLIKELY TO EVER SEE  FRONT LINE SERVICE
EXCEPT POSSIBLY  ON HOSPITAL SHIPS IN THE EVENT OF WAR .

 V COY ALSO HAD OFFICER CADET TURNER , OFFICER CADET B'STARD  AND
MR. CYBERKNIGHT UNDERTAKE THIS TREATMENT DURING THE OPERATION .

   TECHNICAL SGT MEXAL IS REPORTED TO BE UNFIT FOR DUTY AND MAY WELL
BE ON A MEDICAL DISCHARGE FOLLOWING A HIGH DOSE OF I.R. ABSORBED DURING
THE OPERATION , THE REGIMENTAL MEDICAL PANEL ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING
HER SITUATION .

 FOLLOWING THE REORGANISATION OF THE C.M.C. TRAINING COMMAND NEW COURSES
ARE NOW READY AND TRAINING SHALL BE STARTING VERY SOON, INDEED THIS
MONTH V COY ARE HAVING A TRAINING OPERATION AND SOME NEW COURSES WILL
BE AVAILABLE .

### III COY - UPDATE

  III COY SHOULD BE UP TO STRENGTH AGAIN THIS MONTH FOLLOWING THEIR
ACTION ON CROSSROADS 329 ,

 THEY ARE DUE TO FORMALLY RELIEVE THE RESERVE COMPANY ON CROSSROADS
329 LATER THIS MONTH AFTER THEIR LONG ( TOO LONG  -ED )  SPELL OF
R AND R . WE WISH THEM WELL ON THEIR DUTY AND HOPE THAT THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE TROUBLE .

### CROSSROADS 329 , REMEMBERED .

   SOME OF THE MARINES KILLED ON CROSSROADS WERE HONOURED THIS MONTH
IN A SERVICE HELD ON TERRA .

 274 MEDALS WERE AWARDED AND 838 MENTIONS IN DESPATCHES WERE AWARDED
DURING THE OPERATION  AND THE  365 POSTHUMOUS AWARDS WERE MADE TO
THE NEXT OF KIN FOLLOWED BY A SERVICE OF REMEMBRANCE AT THE U.W. HEADQUARTERS
BUILDING . THE C.M.C. MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ABOUT THE OPERATION
:-

    THE C.M.C. ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REMEMBER THESE MEN IN THIS WAY
AS IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE MARINES TO SUFFER THIS AMOUNT OF CASUALTIES
IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME , III COY PROVIDED THE HONOUR GUARD
AFTER THEIR C,O, REQUESTED THE HONOUR AS III COY HAD TAKEN THE MAJORITY
OF THE EARLY CASUALTIES AND SO THEY COULD HONOUR THEIR FALLEN COMRADES
.

 II COY COVERED FOR III COY ON CROSSROADS 329 PRIOR TO THEM TAKING
UP THEIR NEW POSTING ON AURORA NEXT MONTH . 

  THE SITUATION HAS NOW STABILISED ON CROSSROADS 329 MAINLY PAID FOR
IN THE LIVES OF THE MARINES WHO FELL IN THIS OPERATION , WE SHOULD
ALL BE GRATEFUL TO THE MARINES WHO DID NOT RETURN FROM THIS DUTY MANY
WERE KILLED AND MANY MORE WILL NOT BE FIT TO RETURN TO DUTY DUE TO
THE INJURIES THAT THEY RECEIVED . WE WILL NOT FORGET THEM  FOR THE
COST THAT THESE MARINES WERE ASKED TO PAY IS THE COST THAT EVERY MARINE
IS ASKED TO RISK IN EVERY OPERATION THAT THE C.M.C. MOUNT , THEY SHALL
NOT BE FORGOTTEN .

### LETTERS
_REPLIES BY SGT. C. BOY  FROM IV COY_

 HEY SARGE  WHO'S THIS NEW SPECIALIST 1 BLOKE THAT JOINED OUR UNIT
LAST MONTH HE IS SO FULL OF HIMSELF THAT I THINK THAT HE THINKS THE
SUN SHINES OUT OF HIS A**E ,      _ANONYMOUS , I COY_

A)  MARINE THAT ' BLOKE ' AS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY PUT IT IS ONE OF THE
NEW ' SPECIALIST ' RANKS THAT HAS JUST BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE C.M.C.
THE FACT THAT YOU CALL HIM A ' BLOKE ' WILL PROBABLY LAND YOU IN A
LOT OF HOT WATER AS HE HAS THE EQUIVALENT RANK OF AN OFFICER SO DON'T
FORGET TO MENTION SIR  QUITE A BIT WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM AND YOU SHOULD
AVOID A BOLLOCKING WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM .

 HEY SARGE , WHY IS THERE SO MUCH HOSTILITY TO THIS TAC-OPS BOARD
IN VII COY , WHEN I WAS IN VI COY IT WAS SUPERB  AND SAVED US A LOT
OF TIME DURING MISSIONS BECAUSE WE SPENT MORE TIME BRIEFING MARINES
ON THE SITUATION AND LESS TIME GETTING THE JOB DONE ON THE PLANET
, WE HAD ENOUGH ' DOWN TIME ' TO STOP MARINES GETTING COMPLETELY KNACKERED
BECAUSE THEY WERE SPENDING TIME GETTING BRIEFED INSTEAD OF BREWING
UP . _MARINE WYSACK II COY_.

A) THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE VI COY WERE THE ' GUINEAPIGS ' FOR
THIS SYSTEM PRIOR TO JSer-TCom INTRODUCING IT AS A STANDARD OPERATIONAL
PROCEDURE , CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE A FEW ' FLAWS ' IN THE SYSTEM THAT
WILL TAKE TIME TO SORT THEMSELVES OUT AND THE SYSTEM WILL IMPROVE
AS THESE ARE IMPLEMENTED AND MARINES GET USED TO THE NEW RANKS AND
PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN MAKING IT WORK AND AS YOU SAY IT WORKS IN AN
INFORMAL WAY .
