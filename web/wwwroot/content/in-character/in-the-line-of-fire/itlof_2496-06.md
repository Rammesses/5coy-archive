### EXERCISE COMPLETED

A MASSIVE EXERCISE , INVOLVING ALL THE UN-ASSIGNED IV REGIMENT MARINE
UNITS WAS COMPLETED LAST MONTH . ORANGE FORCES WERE NARROWLY DEFEATED
BY BLUE FORCE WHEN A RADAR DETECTOR UNIT OPERATOR SPILT COFFEE OVER
HIS SCREEN AND MISSED AN INBOUND INVASION FLEET AFTER AN ATTEMPT TO
KNOCK OUT THE RADAR GRID WAS FOILED BY THE GROUND FORCE WHO PREFERRED
AN EVENING DOWN THE PUB TO A NIGHT IN THE FIELD TAKING OUT THE GRID
BEACONS .

  THE BLUE TEAM INTEL TEAM CAME UP TRUMPS WHEN THEY OBTAINED THE PASSWORDS
FOR THE EXERCISE DURING A DRUNKEN GUESSING GAME IN A PUB WITH THE
MILITIA TROOPS ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE EXERCISE . BOTH TEAMS WERE
SAID TO BE IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS ALTHOUGH BLUE TEAM MEMBERS WERE SAID
TO BE VERY INQUISITIVE WHILE THEY WERE ENTERTAINED BY THE MILITIA
UNIT ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION .

 ONE BEACON WAS SUCCESSFULLY TAKEN OUT BY V COY ALTHOUGH THE COST
OF REMOVING THIS BEACON WAS HIGH WHEN THE ATTACKING FORCE WAS SPLIT
UP AND SEVERAL MARINES CAPTURED AND TAKEN BACK TO THE BEACON WERE
THE DEFENDING UNIT WAS UNAWARE A CHARGE HAD BEEN PLACED .

  OTHER TEAMS FAILED TO REMOVE THE BEACONS BECAUSE OF A COMPROMISE
BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE TARGETS AND WERE ENGAGED SHORTLY AFTER THEY
HAD BEEN INSERTED INTO HOSTILE TERRITORY . 

COMMAND WERE ' PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE EXERCISE .

### G2 DELAYED

THE V COY FLAGSHIP , THE GARAVAGLIA II  WAS DELAYED EN-ROUTE TO THE
EXERCISE DUE TO A FAILURE WITH ITS SUB-LIGHT DRIVE . THE CAPTAIN HAD
TO INVERT THE COMMAND MODULE AND USE ITS THRUSTERS TO PROPEL THE SHIP
TO TERRA . DURING  THE EXERCISE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF V COY PARTICIPATING
WERE A SQUAD AWAITING THE G2 ON ANOTHER SHIP INSYSTEM .

 CAPTAIN JAQUES , THE COMMANDING OFFICER ON THE FLIGHT CREW OF THE
G2 REPORTED THAT THE DAMAGE SUFFERED A FEW MONTHS AGO HAD CONTRIBUTED
TO THE MALFUNCTION WHEN MINOR DAMAGE TO POWER UNITS HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED
DURING REPAIRS AND THESE UNITS HAD SINCE FAILED UNDER THE STRAIN .

 THE G2 LIMPED INTO DOCKS TWO WEEKS AFTER ENTERING SYSTEM , A JOURNEY
THAT WOULD , UNDER NORMAL POWER TAKE ONLY TWELVE HOURS .

 CAPTAIN JAQUES HAS BEEN COMPLEMENTED ON THE WAY HE MANAGED TO LIMP
THE G2 TO THE DOCK WITHOUT THE USE OF COSTLY SALVAGE VESSELS ASSISTING
HIM .

THE G2 IS EXPECTED TO SPEND AN UNSPECIFIED PERIOD UNDERGOING REPAIR
AND AN OVERHAUL OF SHIP SYSTEMS SO THAT AN INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE
WILL NOT REACCUR IN THE FUTURE AND JEOPARDISE FUTURE SHIP AND C.M.C.
OPERATIONS .
