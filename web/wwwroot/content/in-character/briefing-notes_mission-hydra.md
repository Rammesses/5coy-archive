WARNING: TOP SECRET MATERIAL
:::

##### Begin Message:

All available Marines of 5th company shall embark aboard FTL transport
‘Garavaglia Il’ (CSR 362285-1) for immediate high-displacement transit to planet
Groombridge (CPD ref 130.50) as security contingent for UW Weapons
Inspection Team 820, ordered to investigate radiation buildup detected sector
661, the Chidan/Kasdunni/Pelagir neutral zone. Data sheets follow.

Due to the instability in the region, this operation is to be carried out covertly. All
CMC personel are to assume the cover of mercenary forces and use will be
made of an ACTIVE mercenary support facility. The cover of the CMC and the
UW team must be maintained at all times. (see additional operational notes,
attached) No direct support will be available during the operational phase of the
mission.

##### Note:

Full situation briefing shall be conducted aboard the Facility Support Vessel
Kreyszig, currently in parking orbit above Groombridge with cargo of one type 8
support facility module, currently being used by the UW team as a sensor
platform. Covert insertion maneuver #4 shall be implemented. See Operational
Description for more detail.

Turner, J, CSM - for Gen. Sullivan.

### Special Operational Requirements:

##### Dropship Maneuvers:

Insertion into the operational area shall use Covert Insertion Maneuver #4. Both
of the Garavaglia’s dropships shall depart simultaneously, presenting a single
radar target until atmosphere penetration is complete and an altitude of 100m
h/g is achieved. Dropship #1, with the operational team aboard shall then drop
to 30m h/g and fly low-level to the target insertion point. Dropship #2 shall
perform a monitoring sweep, logged and accepted by the Groombridge
government as a decoy, before rendezvousing with #1 for the return flight to the
Garavaglia. During these single-trace maneuvers, a ‘distance of not more than
10m between ships shall be maintained.

##### Covert Operations:

This operation is designated as COVERT. Hence, all operational personel shall
remove any item of equipemt or insignia that might link them to the Corps or the
UW. All personel shall be checked by the security detail prior to dropship
embarkation.

During the operational phase of the mission, all personell MUST maintain their
cover personas at all times as detection at any stage would completely null the
effectiveness of the mission. Note that under no circumstances shall any
personell be deemed expendable, even if the cover is broken (see Recovery
Proceures below).

##### Recovery Procedures:

Due to the covert nature of this mission, Covert Insertion Maneuver #4 shall be
implemented for the recovery of the operational team at the prearranged Evac-
rendezvous. In the event that the team needs emergency Evac (due to blown
cover or other circumstances), the ESU carried by the team commander shall be
enabled. 60 minutes following activation, evac pickup shall be effected at the
ESU coordinates. Note that it is the team commander's responsibility to find an
evac site suitable for the drop-ship pickup. In an emergency Evac situation, the
dropship will not wait at the rendezvous for more than 5 minutes to avoid
detection, and will fire upon anyone approaching it without identification. The
ESU includes an ID facility.

### Extract from CMC Report No. 163324/a "The Groombridge Bush War"

By Prof. Emeritus Daniel Bowes, University of Europe, Geneva, Sol Ill

##### Summary: 

The Groombridge Bush War is one of the best documented conventional
conflicts available to the historian. Initiated in 2175, the conflict was primarily a
territorial dispute between United Europe and Japan, the two powers exploiting
that planet at the time. Both wanted exclusive control of the rich fuel-ore
deposits on the 2nd continent in what has now become the Chidan Region.
Initially, arbitration seemed to be working, but small incidents between forces of
both sides escallated in a classic 'tit-for-tat’ scenario.

The Bush War ranged back and forth over most of the second continent during
the years 2175-2180 with neither power able to exert overriding control over the
area. Guerilla tactics were used extensively in the early part of the conflict, with
severe losses to both sides due to the use of standard projectile and high
explosive weaponry. But the most disturbing and contraversial engagements
were in 2179, when United Europe initiated the use of tactical nuclear weapons
in the 50kT range in raids on Japan’s orbital lift facilities. Japan in turn replied
with ground-launched ballistic missiles carrying multiple warheads, and the
conflict looked set to wipe out the planet entirely.

However, without the use of its orbital lift facility and with few orbit capable craft,
Japan was unable to retaliate in the same volme as UE could dispatch from its
orbiting arsenals, believed to be provided and run by Military Mercantile, who
even then had a vested interest in the weapos-grade ore deposits of the 2nd
continent and polar regions. In the conflict, however, the majority of the 2nd
continent's deposits were contaminated, making them unsuitable for
exploitation.

Japan finally conceeded before the planet became uninhabitable, although
much of the 2nd continent was blasted - with what has become the Kasdunni
and Chidan regions suffering most notably as the fluid neutral zone ranged
across the continent. Indeed, it is believed that both sides set up silos and
bunkers of their weapons systems in what has become the Kasdunni/Chidan
border region, although due to the nature of the conflict, records of such military
installations have been lost.

Most fortunately, the polar areas and the oceans were almost unaffected, with
their mineral deposits and food sources unscathed. Hadthe water cycle been
more heavily polluted by the use of nuclear weapons, it is unlikely that
Groombridge could have survived as a colony, even in those areas of the planet
not directly affected by the conflict.
