:::

The Type 12 Experimental Station is designed as a
fast setup base for experimental research. It can be
dropped into its operational position from orbit within
a standard Mark Ill re-entry capsule, for which it self-
errects within 15 minutes.

Powered from an enclosed Type 3 micro-pile power
unit as standard, more permanent installations may
be supplied trom a Type 9 micro-fusion reactor
embedded 10m_ below the facility. In_ this
configuration, the setup time for the facility is
increased to 24 hours.

The Type 12 facility is constructed from a triple-wall duroplast film,
inflated by local atmosphere or compressed air supplied from an
auxiliary cylinder.

Airlocks on all entry and exit points allow the facility to be
used in most hostile environments, even (with special options) on a
seabed in 50m of water.
