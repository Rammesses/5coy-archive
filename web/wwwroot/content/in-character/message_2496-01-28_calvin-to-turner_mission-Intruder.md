Re: Mission Intruder

Hi Turner

What does IRAG have on “GEMSTONE”, “Homeworld” and “Restryk”? Somewhere in the murky
depths of my memory | have a connection between “Restryk” and Genetic Engineering,
especially the GEM’s found on Rhylanor / Innsolon Ill.

Looks like we have a chance to check it out BEFORE we hit dirt see what you can dig up.
Maybe a chase on UW funding of cargo manifests out to the system. Somebody has to have
some data somewhere!

Many Thanks

Calvin.
