Company.

A more detailed chronicle of events in the intervening period will be =
published shortly.

Any specific character instructions will be issued with the joining =
pack, which will be sent to you immediately prior to the event they will =
be based around the (what my character has been doing) info that you =
have supplied assuming you have supplied it!

## July 2497

* Measures are introduced by the UW president which legitimise the full =
corporate ownership of Planets, effectively putting them outside of the =

council rubber-stamps the decision. Suspicions rise that the new UW =
president is a puppet appointee.

## September 2497

* A full Public enquiry into the now so-called GEMS INCIDENT starts in a =
blaze of media speculation.

* 5th Company is stood down into a training rotation; various members are =
called to give evidence at the enquiry. Which of their number actually =

## November 2497

* In a totally unprecedented public media broadcast the UW president =
issues a presidential order (normally only used in times of war) =
reducing the CMC back to the role of Galaxy wide police force, and =
appearing to announce the reformation of Special Forces units under the =
direct control of the UW President.

* Vanessa Parnell is appointed as a special presidential adviser appearing =
to confirm widely held public suspicions that the president is nothing =

Marshall.

* All serving members of 5th Company are transferred and the company =
colours are laid up at regimental HQ.

* The G2 is mothballed and its dropships redesignated back to #1 & #2 and =
redeployed to other units. The gunship is apparently de commissioned.

* Members of 5th Company are now scattered to the ends of the galaxy some =
still in the CMC others outside in Civvy Street.=20

* Contact is sparse until out of the blue all members find themselves at =
the heart of a CIB investigation as part of the ongoing GEMS inquiry.

myth.

explored and colonised space.

* A number of supply ships fail to reach there destinations, and two =
colonies are reported as being found empty apparently abandoned. =

the stories.

* It becomes more and more apparent that the Corporations have infiltrated =
all levels of the UW and their influence continues to grow daily.

survey vessel. A strange fate for a fully equipped cruiser class troop =
transport.

position as Sky Marshall. The official reason for this sudden and very =
early retirement is that he is to take over as C.E.O. of the family firm =
Sjvenson Fire and Rescue.

* Ex members of 5th Company are shocked and sceptical, was he forced out. =
Many attempt to contact him but are prevented from speaking to him.

certain former officers and senior NCO's prior to leaving for the family =
firms HQ on Sol3.

## January 2501

* Passenger Liner attacked by ship which 'Came out of nowhere'=20

* The succession of bizarre incidents which seem to be plaguing the =
Galaxy, take a nasty turn when a Hainsworthy luxury liner is attacked =
and destroyed by a mysterious cruiser class warship. The distress call =
contains the lines that the ship just 'appeared out of nowhere'.
Fleet cruiser the 'Adamant' is dispatched to search for the vessels and =
finds debris consistent with a space battle, but no survivors and no =
trace of the attacking ship.

* Publicly the UW dismisses the incident, as Pirate activity; privately =
sources within the UW and High Command are baffled and worried.

## October 2501

Extract from CNN Newsline: Dateline 7/10/2501

PROMINENT EX CMC OFFICER KILLED IN EQUIPMENT TESTING ACCIDENT

A spokesman for the Sjvenson Fire and Safety Company of Sol3 confirmed =
that reports of an equipment testing accident at its base on Neptune =
were correct, and announced that it was with deep regret that they could =
also confirm that the C.E.O. General J. Sjvenson had been killed when an =
experimental shuttle/Lifter that he was piloting crashed when it =
suffered a massive hull breach. No further details are available at this =
time.

With these few terse lines in CNN Newsline it appears that the book is =
finally closed on 5th Company of the Colonial Marine Corps.=20
Further details emerge but they are confused and contradictory, what was =
the C.E.O. of a major corporation doing flying an untried shuttle and =
apparently without proper safety backup. To his ex comrades from 5th =
Company it just makes no sense.

A few days later they individually receive invitations from the CMC to =
attend a memorial service for the General on sol3 many decide to accept

Strangely and almost at the same time, a number of them receive an =
e-mail message inviting them to a wake party to be held on the generals =
instructions as contained in his will, The wake is to take place at a =
bar not far from the sol3 shuttle lift base. The message closes with a =
note saying that it will be worth there while attending. The message =
traces back to the Sjvenson Company.

Those who accept receive a travel ticket and a cheque for out of pocket =
expenses and are told that a Sjvenson Company rep will host the wake. =
And that transport will be provided to the venue.

The wake is set for the 23rd of the 10th 2501 at 21.30 hours.
