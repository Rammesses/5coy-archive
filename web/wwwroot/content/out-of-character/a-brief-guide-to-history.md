By the turn of the 21st century, the various power blocs on
Earth had shifted their concerns from political to economic
factors. This drastic change of emphasis was caused mainly by
the imminent exhaustion of the planet's resources, combined
with the excesses of the 19th and 20th centuries, which were
having a serious effect on the global climate.

Europe by then was a single market, which together with the
USA, and Japan dominated the world economy. The Third World
nations were ina state of rapid decline, as were several
previously stable countries, causing huge civil and
nationalistic wars to break out all over the globe. The power
blocs were blamed by all of the countries who had become
involved in these conflicts, and there were mass. pull-outs
from the United Nations (UN) - which by 2010 had lost any
authority it previously held, andwas no longer inany way
representative of the nations of Earth.

As these wars escalated, the power blocs (despite being the
only groups with the power to sort out the mess that Earth
had become), found themselves isolated diplomatically from
other countries. It was then that the large multi-nationals
openly displayed the power that they had secretly held for
some time. They quickly dominated the worlds communications
networks, and with it the flow of information, as they became
the only "trusted" group many countries would deal with.

By 2030, Earth was more at peace than it had been since the
beginning of the 21st century, and despite the food
shortages, man's thoughts once more turned towards the stars.
In 2040, man finally set foot on Mars, and by 2050 a colony
had been established on the Moon, which although not totally
self-sufficient was still regarded as a viable economic
concern. At the same time, the advancing technology of the
orbital stations almost allowed them to become colonies in
their own right. However none of this helped to alleviate
Earth's situation, as only the rich or highly educated had
access to them. The population was fast reaching critical
level, as it rapidly neared the maximum that the Earth could
support.

In 2063, the first Star Drive was patented by a Belgian
scientist, Henri Le Geere, working for United Europe (UE).
However, he was soon kidnapped by an alliance of two
corporations, who persuaded Le Geere that his future lay with
them. Thus Blackwell Power and Parnell Industries built the
first star ship - the Santa Marie. Her maiden voyage in 2065
to Proxima Centuri was a success, both technically and
politically, when an inhabitable planet was discovered.
Despite the secrecy behind the Star Drive, it took only two
years for the other corporations and power bloc countries to
replicate the drive, andthe large scale exploration of
nearby systems began.

The UN declared Proxima Centuri open to all, and as this
decision was not contested by any government or corporation,
the colonisation of the new world began. Despite intensive
efforts to the contrary, Earth's population finally reached
critical level, and what became known as the "Food Wars"
started in earnest. In desperation, all space-capable
organisations commenced the large scale evacuation of
refugees to Proxima Centuri, and also to a newly discovered
water world around Alpha Centuri.

It was during this period that the first recorded case of
space combat occurred - between two scout-class ships. One
was a UE vessel, (the St Christophe), and the second belonged
to the Blackwell Power Corporation (the Tasrun) - in 2075.
The fight took place around the Groombridge System, the scene
of many more battles in years to come. The UE ship won the
engagement, and so claimed the Groombridge system on behalf
of the UE. Exploration began to slow, due to a combination of
several factors - the re-colonisation of Earth's excess
population, which subsequently reduced the demand for new
worlds to colonise; and the increasing number of ships’ that
seemed to disappear without a trace.

In 2125, the first large-scale territorial war broke on the
world of Groombridge; initially between the UE and Japan, but
before long the corporations also became involved. In This,
the ‘Groombridge Bush War', planetary bombardment was used
for the first time, which devastated the planet and killed
millions. The major result of the war was the formation of an
investigative/watch-dog authority, inan attempt to police
space.

In 2135, Parnell Industries discovered the ' Jump
Synchronicity Enabler' (JSE), which drastically increased the
speed and distance of which jumps through space could be
made. The cost of the device however, remained prohibitively
expensive, for all but the most powerful of countries. Lt
was mainly the major corporations who could afford the JSE,
and thus they began to take the lead from governments, with
Parnell Industries itself rapidly becoming the leading
corporation, by keeping a carefully maintained strangle-hold
over the JSE.

Between 2185 and 2200, the number of scout-class' ships
disappearing increased, and of the majority that did return -
Or were discovered adrift - the crews were found to be either
dead or insane. No cause for this phenomenon was found until
2200, when a laboratory on Alpha Centuri discovered a new
form of radiation, which they named Incapacitating Radiation
(IR). It seemed to exist all over the galaxy in widely
varying amounts, and it was soon confirmed that the ships
were disappearing in high spots of this radiation. Screens
were soon developed to protect ships and their crews from the
effects of IR, and the exploration of space continued.

The next 100 years saw the gradual spreading of mankind
through-out the stars, with Earth still governing the new
colonies that were established. However, 17: 2297 the
"Colonial War" broke out, as many colonies tried to break
free of the Mother-world's domination. For once, all of
Earth's goverments and the Earth-based corporations worked
together, in an attempt to crush the rebellion and maintain
the status quo. However, many corporations had by this stage
abandoned Earth as a base of operations, and thus sided with
the break-away worlds.

Over the next quarter of a century, planetary bombardment was
implemented on avery large scale, utilising both nuclear and
conventional devices. It is still impossible to this day to
calculate both the loss of human life, and the destruction of
materials and land. Eventually Earth conceded defeat, and
new federation of United Worlds (UW) was formed. However,
those worlds who had been independant for the duration of the
Colonial War refused to join this new organisation, and in
many cases are still independant of the UW to this day.
Despite this, the UW were determined to keep the peace
through-out the colonies, where so much had already been
lost, anda number of treaties were drawn up and signed by
all members. Even the independant colonies were pressured
into signing treaties dealing with arms limitation.

The main, and by far the most controversial arms limitation
treaty, involved the banning of the manufacture and use of
all projectile weapons, and their phasing out in civilian as
well as military life. (Weapons using IR had been developed
as marketed as a much cleaner and ‘environmentally friendly'
form of warfare). The banning of all nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons was also covered by the Arms Limitation
Treaties, and was accepted with relief by most worlds.

The UW was like the old UN on Earth, with each world having
a place on the council, andan excutive committee with
a rotating membership. Large corporations were also
represented at the £Uw, and in practice actually hold the
bulk of the seats, either directly (ie. they own a world
and thus its vote), or indirectly (i.e. they are the
major employer/influence on a planet, and thus its
government does as they ask). The presidency of the UW has,
Since its inception, been held by the head of Parnell
Industries, though this is not mandatory. (However, as no
Single group has yet had the power to break Parnell's hold
over the UW, when elections for president are held, no
rival candidates have been able to contest the position).

To enforce the UW's edicts and the new arms laws, the old
investigative/watchdog authority was given a military arm and
new, far-reaching powers. It was renamed the "Colonial Marine
Corps" and recruited its members from all inhabitated worlds,
but mainly from the core (or established) worlds.

In the aftermath of the Colonial War, most worlds were forced
to concentrate on rebuilding their shattered economies, and
in this chaos some of the newer colonies based on the
furthest edge of humanity's expansion were forgotten, and
thus left to fend for themselves. The most notable of these
tO come ito light so far is Aitair fV, which due toa
combination of high background IR, and the contamination left
by nuclear devices used early in the war, suffered from rapid
social regression, anda drastic mutation of the surviving
human stock. This mutation was severe enough for its victims
to be regarded by some as alien, andcertainly to almost
qualify as a new human sub-species - the Urthankol.

A technological back-lash swept through the worlds, as many
new developments were lost or abandoned in the need to
reconstruct civilisation. The R & D departments of most of
the major corporations suffered heavily as a result of
bombings or corporate sabotage - no-one wanted to leave any
competitors ahead!

In the past 168 years, the human race would appear to have
matured and stabilised, and other than minor flare-ups
confined to single planets or at the worst a system, no wars
have been fought. There are a number of so-called freedom
fighters and terrorist groups, most notable of which is’ the
"Brotherhood", which claims to fight for a variety of
‘worthy’ causes.

To date, there has been no proven contact with alien
life-forms.

Through-out recent years, Colonial Marine's have been
stationed on virtually every populated planet, and some that
have yet to be colonised. Their main objective is to keep the
peace in situations where local law enforcement is unable to
cope, and to combat the growing threat of terrorist groups,
that generally treat the CMS as the outward face of all that
they are fighting against.
