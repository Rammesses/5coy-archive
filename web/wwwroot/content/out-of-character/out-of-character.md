Right from the start, the Colonial Marines experience was envisaged as a rich
universe, where corporations were vying for resources and power across a large
swathe of the Milky Way.

By creating the out-of-character resources found here, the scenatio writers were
able to avoid simplistic "monster of the week" gameplay in favour of a series
of episodes in a much larger set of story arcs. 

These ongoing storylines and recurring characters gave the games an edge over the
more usual shoot-em-up style favoured by other groups at the time, and were
vital in engaging the players in the action.
