# Writer's Notes

### 1.1 - INTRODUCTION

The Writers Guide is a set of articles designed to form the background to the Dark Horizons Science-Fiction universe. It has been compiled from the original notes used in the — of scenarios, and
expanded to give as full coverage as possible of the many aspects of the sci-fi universe, to make
scenarios more consistent and complete.

These articles can be thought of as canon, but should not be a straight-jacket for the scenario writer - if
a scenario idea requires the rethinking or reworking of an aspect of the background material, then the
background can be reworked, or at least a compromise reached, without the idea being rejected.

Also part of the Guide are descriptions of some of the designs of props, ships and other items that have been made to date. For specialist props and vehicles, details of which mission they were used on, and how these fit into the campaign background are included for reference. It is hoped that this will prevent duplication of effort in the future.

In certain cases, one or two people have become de-facto guardians of particular aspects of the system, the technology behind supra-light travel being a case in point. These people have taken responsibility
for the development of these ideas, often as a result of writing scenarios for the system, and are both a peo resource, and provide contiunuity within the system, so should be consulted wherever possible.

It his hoped that the Writer’s Guide will grow wwith contributions from both players and staff as the game system itself matures and grows, to form a comprehensive reference work, Therefore, included in this section are articles on writing scenarios for the system, and on authoring articles for this work.

### 1.2 - WRITING SCENARIOS

This article provides a guide to the content of a new scenario, as well as notes on some areas of the campaign universe that need cross-checking to ensure consistency.

#### Sources of Information

As with all writing where the fictional universe is well-grounded, the author must always strive to remain consistent with the feel’ of the universe, its technical areas, and also with "historic events’.
This "Writers Guide’ forms the basis for the first two, and the latter is covered fully by the numerous issues of ’in character’ news-sheets available, occasionally supplimented by Writers Guide’ articles.
Indeed, having a complete library of back issues of those news-sheets is invaluable reference. The "Writers Guide’ article, "An Overview of the Dark Horizons Universe’ is also one of the basic references for writing scenarios.

#### Template for Scenario Documents

The following template is a guide to the format of a scenario document. It is designed to let the
reader quickly understand the scenario, but give all the detail required to implement the scenario at a
| game. The document should use a numeric section numbering system (i.e. 1 - section one, 1.1 - section one, subsection one etc) for easy cross referencing.

##### 1: Precis

This section gives an overview of the scenario, including any links to previous events or compai
background material. From this section alone, the reader should understand the overall flow of the
scenario, and the basic background behind it.

##### 2: Segments

A number of sections that detail the flow of the scenario. Typically, there will be one or two
segments per day of play. Planned events are detailed in these sections. Footnotes are used to add in
any extra information not directly necessary to the segment, but useful as background. There should
almost always be the following four segments in any scenario:

    1. Briefing on Friday night
    2. Saturday night mission
    3. Sunday morning mission
    4. Debrief on Sunday

Obviously, the above are specifically for 48 hour scenarios, but shorter ones will require at least three segments (typically (1), (2) & (4)). Of course, if more encounters are planned (and usually several are needed for Friday night and during Saturday), more segments should be included, The
order of the segments should be based roughly on when the encounters are to occur, so if a scenario
has two ‘threads’ (i.e. two main lines of action within the story - for example Mercenary and Marine
player teams operating independantly), the encounters for each thread will be interleaved as they
occur in time.

##### 3: List of encounters

A time-sorted list of the encounters planned for the scenario, with short notes, as a quick reference,
again interleaved if the scenario is multi-threaded. It may be useful to provide a separate encounter
list for each thread as well.

##### 4: List of props

A list of all special props required for the scenario is very important if any have to be made specially
for the game, Equally, if any props are to be re-used from an earlier game, listing them in the
scenario document gives plenty of warning so that they can be prepared, dusted off and brought
along to the game.

##### 5: Character biographies

Each major NPC should have a short biographical entry in this section, including references to previous
encounters with the players. Remember that for new NPC characters, this bio will be what the person
playing the NPC will base the character on, so providing as much information as possible helps them to
play the role the way it was envisaged. This is particularly important if the NPC is to be re-used in a
later scenario or as a regular item (for example Colonel Nasco (see Intersella and his "Writers Guide’
co for background)), For regular NPC characters, the person who plays the role should be noted as
well.

#### 2.6 Sugar Mice Mercenary Unit

_**Background:**_

The Sugar Mice Mercenary Unit (more usually just known as “The Mice”) was probably formed in the
early 80's. Initially, it was a very loose group of mercenaries, with a fluid membership. During these
initial years, few records exist of the Mice’s activities.

This changed in 2487, when Avo Stetto joined the group. AWOL from 2coy CMC, Stetto brought more
discipline to the Mice, as well as a sense of group identity that was lacking before. He soon was voted
in as commander of the group after the previous leader leaft the Mice in the Fall of 2487.

With his contacts in various government’s military, as well as good corporate contacts, Stetto raised the
profile of the Mice until they became one of the most respected Mercenary groups.

After this point, more records exist, and the mistory of the Mice after this point is given below.

_**Known Members:**_

>    | Name                  | Speciality / Role | Nickname / Callsign |
>    | --------------------- | --- | --- |

_**Summary of Operational History:**_

Unknown


Mission Bravo Hotel Hotel - Operation "Genesis" executed.



Contracted for Mission Bravo Hotel Hotel - Operation "Genesis". Prep begins.

Joel Turner joins the Mice as computer expert at the tender age of 19, gaining
the nickname “ICEMan” during mission prep because of his uncanny affinity
with computers and electronics.

Turner is inserted into a Network Systems local office and uses the Area
Manager's codes to retrieve the designs for the corporation's newest FTL-
Comms equipment. The codes were obtained by paying an off-world prostitute
to seduce the Manager, sedate him and interrogate him using truth serum. The
client, IntelCorp arranges extraction, as well as an "accident" for the Network
Systems Area Manager.

The Mice take a furlough on Insert Planet Name. Contracted for Mission
Foxtrot Hotel Hotel - Operation “Insert Mission Name”. Prep begins.

Mission Foxtrot Hotel Hotel - Operation “Jnsert Mission Name” executed.

The mission falls appart due to false inteligence from the contractor. Not only
were the specifications for the security forces and systems of the target highly
inaccurate, but the Contractor failed to inform the Mice that the target building
had been completely rebuilt after a fire the previous year (caused by a previous
aborted operation). Hence all the plans of the building and environs were
completely wrong. As the mission was a fast insertion operation, ther was no
time to gather new intelligence once the Mice were on site, and when the Mice
hit heavy security systems, Stetto aborted the mission.

The Mice take furlough on Altair 4. Dexter D6 joins them, immediately being
named “The Kid”, and shows promise as a scout on exercise.

Stetto plans to make an example of the Contractor for Mission Foxtrot Hotel
Hotel - Operation “Avenging Angel”. Preparation begins, and later that month,
an operation to assasinate the executive in charge of the failed mission, as well
as his inteligence gatherer is executed. The operation succeeds, and the Mice
Start to gain a reputation as effective, but hard-nosed mercenaries.

The Mice take furlough on Insert Planet Name.

Contracted for Mission Kilo Hotel Hotel - Operation “Insert Mission Name”.
Prep begins, and the Mice take transport out towards the Rim aboard the scout-
ship "King's Arrow".

Mission Kilo Hotel Hotel - Operation “Jnsert Mission Name” executed.

Mice return from the Rim to the core systems, and take furlough on Jnsert
Planet Name.

Contracted for Mission Bravo Hotel India - Operation “Insert Mission Name”
Mission Bravo Hotel Hotel - Operation “Jnsert Mission Name” executed.

The principal that the Mice were contracted to protect was killed by a tailored
viral agent, inserted into the air-system of the hotel in which the principal
insisted on staying. Shade detected the virus quickly, but was only able to
create the anti-agent after the principal had suffered terminal cellular dammage
from the agent.

The Mice take ship.

Jump Drive and navigational systems failure strands the Mice and all aboard
for a month in deep space. It takes a further month for the ship to limp back to
the edge of the Core.

The Mice take furlough on Jnsert Planet Name.

Contracted for Mission Golf Hotel India - Operation “Insert Mission Name”.
Prep begins.

Mission India Hotel India - Operation “Insert Mission Name” executed.

The Mice take furlough on Insert Planet Name.

Furlough continues.

During this period, D6 has his infamous experience of a zero-G brothel.
Contracted for Mission Alpha India Juliet - Operation "Slingshot". Prep begins.
Mission Alpha India Juliet - Operation "Slingshot" executed.

Funded by the Tyrell Corporation, the objective was to retrieve an unprotected
JSE unit from a Parnell research base. The corporate Exec, J.B. Carter, kept
most of the details of the operation to himself, and insisted on riding shotgun
on the mission, claiming that the access codes were too sensitive to give out,
even to his hired mercenaries. Throughout the mission prep he irritates the
members of the Mice. Additionally, Carter kept the target’s location and parent
corporation a secret from the Mice.

When the Mice got into the base, they found a platoon of corporate security
waiting for them with orders to shoot to kill. The Mice fought hard, and
retreated, loosing Maynard and King in the process. John Crisp had laid mines
and demolition charges, and used these to secure the Mice’s escape. In the
confusion, the Mice got off-planet by whatever means they could, and although
they partially regrouped, the Mice were effectively dissolved at this point, as
Stetto, Gibbson and Wolverton were missing.

Parnell sent secutity teams after the Mice, and Perry and Archer were killed by
Parnell security in a bar on Gateway Station, Terra, less than 3 weeks later.

Additional Notes:

Turner and the two Crisp brothers hired themselves out as part of a joint CMC / Mercenary unit on
Altair 6 during March 2490. Both the Crisp brothers were killed during this action.

Turner met up again with Shade and Williams after his detox course following his use of Dextramol on
Altair 6, and with them joined the CMC in order to get additional protection following a run in with
Parnell security. All three completed their CMC training during Insert date, with Turner gaining the
Rank of Corporal and Comp-Tech 1 qualification - astounding his training officer, Sgt Mjr Kuzak.

Shade and Williams stayed with the Corps for approximately one year, before going AWOL. Nothing
has been heard of them since. Turner stayed with the Corps. A rumour exists that Williams is in a
psychiatric institution on Braconis, although why is unknown.

Of the other survivors of the Mice, nothing more is known.

 


Type 18 Drone

The Type 18 Drone is a multi-mission probe with limited DF jump capability and
provision for one standard soensor package as payload. It can perform multi-
jump transits with a DF of 0.4, using its onboard navigation systems for fully
autonomous mission profiles.

The drone tis a truncated cuboid! . 2m in length, 0.75m wide and 0.5m in depth.
It has few exterior features, the most notable being the ID panel, access door and

associated code-lock, and the pulse-drive vents on the aft ventral surface.
Additionally, on the dorsal surface, on the centerline either side of the access door
are two adhesion pads used for mounting the probe to standard package support
pylons.

What all this means in terms of a scenario is that this prop can be used whenever
some special package has to be retrieved by the players. Its size makes it

transportable, but unwieldy for the players to move. Additionally, electronic props
can be placed within the casing to serve whatever purpose the scenario requires.

 

The Type 18 Jump-Drone

 

1 The casing should be a light grey, possibly a Hammerite smooth finish) with
loads of ’carbon scoring’ airbrushed on as the players will only ever see this prop
after it has re-entered a planetary atmosphere.

The Micropile fuel cell should consist of a tubular frame surrounding a
compressed oviod (the pile itself), connected to loads of exciting plumbing that
can leak dangerous-looking fluids, and curious boxes with plenty of flashing lights
and warning signs!

The Jump-Drive and Nav-Comp should be sealed 19" rack mount units, the front
and rear panels with special (and appropriate) legends. Both should be accessible
(and removeable) if the payload and its associated wiring is removed, and hence
are places in the dorsal half of the drone. The players should never have to
disassemble the ventral half of the drone, so the Pulse-Drive and Nav-sensor
package can be dummy units.

Writers Guide Notes (Pll Drive Description’

#### 5.1. Faster Than Light Drives - A Description

_**Introduction:**_

In the Dark Horizons universe, FTL travel is achieved using a ’Jump Drive’
coupled to a ’Jump Synchronicity Enabler (or JSE). This allows starships to move
the Marines between star-systems within the time available between games
whilst maintaining a consistent technical (and most importantly believable)
background. The following is a short, but rather technical explanation of the Jump
Drive and the JSE for direct insertion into the campaign.

> The physics of the Jump Drive were postulated early in the 21st century, when
Unified Field theory finally married the nuclear forces with gravity and
elecromagnetism. The Jump Drive operates by opening a ’hole’ in the fabric of
space-time (or 3-space), causing a ’Quantum Tunnel’ between two real-space
points.
>
> Initially, the direction and length of the tunnel with respect to its real-space
interstices was only marginally controllable, requiring a lengthy and exhaustive
navigation check after even short jumps to determine exactly the point of
emergence. Thus, it became the practice to use many short jumps (or hops) with
a check following each so as not to get lost.
>
> But it was the invention of the Jump Synchronicity Enable by the Parnell
Corporation that opened up mans’ colonisation of the stars. The JSE operates by
using stellar phenomenon imaged at the interstices, coupled with quantum level
sensors to measure much more accurately the duration and direction of the jump,
and hence the length of the hyperspace catenary, much reducing the navigational
calculations required upon emergence. By requiring an order of magnitude less
time to complete the navigational checks, the JSE gave an effective 10-fold
decrease in the length of any multi-jump voyage.
>
> The Jump Field Generator itself consists of three orthogonal, supercooled field
coils, constructed from verternium-cordenite on a titanium/magnesium former,
which are energised by fusion plasma fed directly from a ship’s main fusion
reactors in much the same manner as the sub-light drive.
>
> When energised properly, these coils form three independent, interacting, cycling
hyper-fields which together act on the mass of the ship to ’twist’ it out of nornal
space through the ’Jump Interstices’. Once in 4-space (or hyperspace), the ship
is propelled along a quantum tunnel or catenary embedded in 4-space until that
catenary intersects normal space at a second interstices.
> 
> The following field parameters determine the operation of the Jump Field
Generator:
>
>    | Parameter | Detail |
>    | --------- | ------ |
>    | Overall Field Strength | Determines the size of the combined hyper-field and the size and mass to be ‘twisted’ through the interstices. |
>    | Phase Difference | Phase differences between the cycling hyper-fields selects the catenary direction in 4-space. |
>    | Frequency Difference | Frequency differences between the cycling hyper-fields select the catenary length (and hence the distance travelled in real-space). |
>    | Amplitude Difference | Amplitude differences between the cycling hyper-fields select the catenary 'tightness'. |
>
> Between them , the above parameters determine the emergence point following
the jump, and the ’speed’ of transit. The gravity wells of real-space objects
intersecting a jump-catenary cause the premature emergence of the ship, so
jumps are generally started from and terminated well out of a system.
>
> However, because the drive is effectively selecting a curve joining two points on
the surface of an infinite 4-space hyper-sphere, even the most powerful systems
cannot measure or set the parameters accurately enough to ensure a ’perfect’
jump. It is this inaccuracy that held back colonisation until the invention of the JSE,
as far too many of the prototype jump-ships vanished, never to b heard of again.
> 
> It was discovered that when in hyperspace, the velocity at which a ship is
propelled along the 4-space catenary is not dependant directly upon the hyper-
field strength, but upon the catenary ‘tightness’. The 4-space velocity is
exponentially proportional to the catenary ‘tightness’, so that for a catenary of
‘tightness’ O, the ship will be propelled at a velocity equivalent to real-space
lightspeed, and for the tightest straight-line catenary (‘tightness’ of 1), the ship
would be propelled infinitely fast, effectively occupying all points in the universe
simultaneously.
> 
> Fortunately, the energy required to generate the interstices for and ’select’ a tight
catenary also increases to infinity as the catenary tightness approaches 1, thus
precluding a ship ever achieving instantaneous, Infinity distance jumps and
becoming a singularity.?

Most military ships operate at catenary ‘tightness’ (or Displacement Factor, DF) or
0.6 or slightly more. Most commercial ships would operate at DFs of 0.4. Cargo
carriers would operate at DFs of 0.38. 

Note that speed is exponentially linked to
the Displacement Factor, so that a DF of 0.61 is 5% faster than a DF of 0.6 (as
opposed to 1.5% if the relation were linear). Low DF capable ships are colloquially
termed ’Bunny Hoppers’. |

Unfortunately, the transition through the interstices causes neurological trauma to
sentient beings, this trauma becoming more severe at higher DFs. Most humans
would be driven insane by a Jump with a DF of O.7 or greater, but as the energy
cost of such a jump is so high, this occurs very rarely.

> Catenary 'Tightness is a measured value describing the 4-space curve bhetween the two interstices Of A Jump. It ranges
from O for a catenary that matches in reverse the curve of the
real-space straight line in 4-space to 1 Eor the 4-space straight-line catenary between the two interstices.

Compare this witth Star-Trek’s Warp 10 speed limit.

Introduction

A very specific style has been developed for all in-character paperwork. This style 1s described in
detail in this article. The keeper of the CMC style is Joel Hammond-Turner, and he should be
consulted when creating documents within the style.

The Basic Style

The basic CMC style is designed for nee ee i
printed matter on A4 paper. for smaller or Title ~—_

larger sheets, the style is scaled
| accordingly. The figure below shows a

ty heal page and notes the main features wo
the styie. ,
aca Border ~

 

 

 

| Page Setup Items |
Text —;i
The border is fixed at 5mm from the edge im:
of the page on both sides and at the top of
the page. The bottom border is I2mm.
The border is 5mm wide around the page, |
and J0mm at the head of the page to Bl
accomodate the page title.

 

 

If the page is double sided and to be
bound, then the inside margin becomes
20 mm.

 

 

If the page can’t be printed on a capable
laser printer (for example the writer can : sili ieieamasaeiiemieieaeiess
only print on an HP Deskjet, which has a  Reeasrtemacanaseauaanansees —
wide unprintable bottom margin, then the
bottom margin can be raised to 30mm or
the whole page printed at 90% of full
| size.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title Items

The Title and all text is set in various sizes and weights of the Helvetica or Triumvirate fonts (or a
equivalent) A sample of the font is given below for reference.

The title bar always has the following format:
<CLI number> <Description> <Optional Document Number>

for example: 7M0101 Medical Technician Level 4 Notes. The title is set in REVERSE (i.e. white on
black) BOLD 18 POINT text, except for the CLI Number, which is set in REVERSE BOLD 12
POINT SUPERSCRIPT text, so the top edge of the CLI number alligns with the rest of the title text.
| The left edge of the title text aligns with the inner edge of the border, and the title text is centred top
| to bottom within the thick top border.

Body Text & Headings.
The Body Text is set in an area separated from the page borders by 5mm as shown in the diagram
above. Body text is set in NORMAL 12 POINT text. Headlines (document or section headings) are set
in BOLD 18 POINT text. Headings (within documents or sections) are set in UNDERLINED BOLD
12 POINT text. Sub-Headings, Sub-Sub-Headings and Sub-Sub-Sub-Headings (see the notes on
numbering below) are all set in BOLD 12 POINT text. Any lower headings are set in the same style as
the body text. Other items with specific styles within in-character CMC documents include:

Examples ITALIC 12 POINT CENTERED text
Important points BOLD ITALIC 12 POINT text
Lists As body text
Tables As body text

Images

Any images or diagrams inserted within a document should either fill the width of the text area, or else
fill half the width, maintaining the 5m separation from the page borders. All images should be
surrounded by a @.5pt black border.

Numbering

There is also a standard numbering system for in-character CMC documents.

 

Document Numbers

Every document must be pigeon-holed within a CLI designation. For example, Med-Tech training notes
comes under 7MO1 - 7 for training, M for medical, 01 for primary training. Similarly, the Training
Course Personnel Form comes under 7801 - 7 for training, S for support services, and 01 for primary
suport services.

Additionally, to aid tracking the originator of any document, each one has a document ID number of the
for xxx/xxx/a. For example, the Training Course Personnel Form above has the document number
942/003/A. 942 refers to the person who designed or wrote the document, 003 is a document number
assigned by the originator, whilst A is the revision number.

Originator numbers and CLI numbers are maintained by Joel Hammond-Turner, who should be
consulted for CLI pigeon-holing and issue of originator numbers.

S--tion Numbers

Sections (or paragraphs) within a document are numbered in a ’tree’ format. Each sub-division of a
section (or subn-section) adds an additional number to the chain, thus:

4 41 4.1.1, 4,1,2
~ 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3
4

5 5.1 5.1.landsoon
Page Numbers
The page numbering for a document will depend on whether the document is stand-alone, or part of a
larger meta-document. In the former case, a normal linear numbering system is used. In the latter, each
document will be allocated a page-number prefix, but is otherwise numbered similarly. Page numbers

are set in BOLD 12 POINT text in the outside bottom corner of the page border, with the right side
aligned to the inside of the border..

## Codes and Idents

### Introduction:

This document provides an overview of all the codes and callsigns that a Colonial
Marine may encounter, including usage, and formats.

Note: [dents will be described in terms of Alphabetic (alpha or A), Numeric

(num or N), General alpha-numeric (gen or G) and separator ( - / et al) characters.

### 1.0 Personal Ident Codes - ANN/GNNN/GNN

Every person within the United Worlds has a Personal Ident Code issued by the
Colonial Service the first time they leave their planet of origin. The CS-PID has the
form `alpha num num/ gen num num num/ gen num num` optionally prefaced with a four-letter code denoting the system and planet of origin
(see below). So, for example, a full code might be:

```
SOL-3/C19/5105/5869
```

### 2.0 Marine Ident Codes - AANNNNNN

Every Marine is issued with a Marine Personal Ident upon comissioning. This code
has the form `aloha aloha num num num num num num` optionally prefaced with the Ident code of the company the Marine is to be attached
to. The first two alphabetic characters of the code are formed by the initial letters of the first name and surname of the Marine. For example

```
IV-5/TJ121710
```

### 3.0 Corporate Ident Codes

Practically all Corporations assign their employees an identification code or number
of some sort for internal use. There is no standardisation of the format of these
codes.

### 4.0 Radio Callsigns

The Colonial Marine Corps has a set of standard formats for radio call-signs, which
are detailed in the following sub-sections. Corporate forces do not use any standard
callsign-formats.

#### 4.1 CMC Tactical Callsigns - A

Tactical callsigns are single character codes used to describe major tactical units.
These codes are most often used in the transmission of Mission Status messages.
They have a simple single character alpha format. For example:

>    | Callsign | Tactical Grouping          |
>    | -------- | -------------------------- |
>    | Alpha    | CMC HQ / Command           | 
>    | Tango    | Operational Group          |
>    | Hotel    | Support Group / Mothership |

Note: Single character codes are also used for tactical operation codes, where they
are prefixed by the word ‘code’, as described below.

#### 4.2 CMC Operational Callsigns - A-N[N]

Operational callsigns are used between squads and personel of the Operational
Group during a mission. These codes are allocated during initial briefing process and
remain in force for the duration of the mission. Each squad is given a different initial
character as an identifier, followed by dash-one. Messages calling using this code
are given to the squad commander for his attention. The callsign is usually (but not
exclusively) based on the initial letter of the squad name. For example:

>    | Callsign  | Tactical Grouping |
>    | --------- | ----------------- |
>    | Kilo-1    | Kestrel Squad     |
>    | Foxtrot-1 | Falcon Squad      |

Sub-units within the squads are designated with sub-codes. Calls using the
sub-codes are given for the attention of the leader of the sub-unit. For example:

>    | Callsign | Spoken        | Tactical Grouping |
>    | ---------| ------------ | ---------- |
>    | Kilo-11  | Kilo Wun Wun | Kestrel Squad, First Team (Command) |
>    | Kilo-12  | Kilo Wun Too | Kestrel Squad, Second Team (Support)  |

#### 4.3 CMC Personal Radio Callsigns - ANN

Personal radio callsigns identify individual marines. When a Marine is cleared for
radio use (either by completion of a Communications Operator course, or by direct
authorisation from a CommTech-2 Marine), he is given a permanent personal radio
callsign. The OlC(Comms) must be informed of the PRCs of all Marines cleared for
radio use for each operation. The Marine’s PRC is added to his Personel database
record. PRCs have the format `alpha num num`.

Again, the callsign may be optionally prefixed with the Marine Company designator
code. For example:

>    | Callsign | Spoken        |
>    | ---------| ------------ |
>    | IV-5/S-08 | Fower Fife Sierra Zero eight |
>    | A-34 | Alpha Tree Fower | 

#### 5.0 Tactical Operational Codes

Tactical Operation Codes (TOCs) are used during the transmission of operational

status messages. Both single character and word codes are used, always prefixed
with the word ‘code’. For example:

Code Yankee Insertion of operational group complete

Code Zulu Extraction of operational group required.

Code X-Ray Emergency Evac. of operational group required ASAP
Code Fireflash Detonation of Hi-Ex weapons by threat forces confirmed

Code Earthshock Destruction of orbital lift facilities (orbit end) by threat
forces confirmed

When status messages are being transmitted, several TOCs can be used in
combination. In this case, the prefix ‘code’ is used only once. For example:

Code Maverick Olympus
Note: The above is not a complete list. Some TOCs are of high security clearance
and/or for Officer's eyes only.

#### 6.0 Equipment ident Codes - NANN

Whilst the Corporations have no standard for identifing equipment types, the CMC
has specified a set of codes that can describe the operational type of any piece of
equipment. These codes are most often seen on the equipment itself, as this
legending is a requirement for all equipment specified by CMC Procurement.
The code has the form `Num Alpha Num Num`

The first digit represents the ‘command level’ of the equipment within its own
environment, ranging from 1 (primary command equipment) to 9 (Maintenance
Support equipment). The alpha character represents the ‘command area’ the
equipment is to be used in, and the final two digits form a type identifier.

#### 6.1 Command Level identifiers

The following is a list of the Command Level Identifiers (CLIs) used in ElCs.

Primary Command Equipment

#### 7.0 Equipment Shipping Ident Codes

Whenever equipment or bulk cargo is shipped from one planet to another, a shipping
ident pannel is affixed to it. Although there is no standardisation between shipping
lines and the CMC, all shipping ident panels must of necessity display the same
information, regardless of format. The information required Is:

Shipboard Cargo Ident
Unique Cargo Ident
Destination Code
Owner Ident

Cargo Type Code
Shipboard Location
Handling Notes

Note: The Unique Cargo Ident is in fact only unique to the shipping line.

#### 8.0 Vessel Ident Codes NNNNNN-N

All space-going vessels must be registered with the Colonial Ship Registry, which
allocates a Vessel Ident Code that is used as the vessel’s callsign. The code has the
format `num num hum num num num - num`.

Usually, the code is prefixed with ’CSR’ to indicate that it is a VIC. For example

CSR 362285-1

#### 9.0 Planetary Short Codes - AAA-N[N]

Many of the codes described above use the standard planetary short code as a
prefix. The PSC was developed for interstellar shipping lines to standardise cargo
manifests. The PSC has the format `aloha alpha alpha - num (num)` representing the system and planet number. It is optionally suffixed with the Colonial
Planetary Database catalogue number for the system and planet. Sometimes, only
the three letter system code is used, and the item is assumed to be for the major
starport in the system.

For example `ALC-4 (5590.4)` or more simply `ALC`.

A partial list of PSCs is given below.

Aloha Centauri

ALC-4 (5590.4)
Aurora AUR-3 (4450.3)
Barnards World BAR-3 (6990.3)
Bessiers BES-4 (4110.4)
Beta Hydri BHY-2 (190.2)
Braconis BRA-4 (2260.4)
Chi Draconis DRA-3 (7130.3)
Dawn DWN-3 (4670.3)
Fomalhaut FHT-3 (8810.3)
Groombridge GRM-3 (150.3)
Kruger KGR-3 (8600.3)
Lumiere LUM-2 (7640.2)
Monro MON-3 (540.3)
Paronis PAR-3 (1330.3)
Proxima Centauri PRC-3 (5510.3)
Rhalanor RHA-3 (480.3)
Ross ROS-3 (9050.3)
Sirius SIR-4 (2440.4)

The Terran system is a special case, and has PSCs for each planet in the system. A
partial list is given below. Only the three letter code is ever used for planets in the
Terran system

Sol, Terra TER (0.0)
Sol, Luna LUN (0.1)
Sol, Neptune NEP (0.5)

#### 10.0 Message Identification

All messages sent via the data communications networks have to have two
identifying headers - the Message Ident and the Commnet Path. These provide,
respectively, a compressed summary of the message’s routing and status
information, and a list of all the data nodes the message has passed through to
reach its destination.

#### 10.1 Message Ident

The Message ID, providing a compress summary of routing and status information,
has the following format:

<date> <time> <timeframe> <originator> <originator location> <destination>
<destination location> <flags> <ID Code>

<date> NN/NN/NN Standard day first date string
<time> NN:NN:NN = Standard HH:MM:SS time string
<timeframe> AAA Usually either LOC (for local time
frame) or GAL (for Galactic time
frame)
~ <originator> AAA First three letters of originator’s
surname
<oOriginator location> AAA First three letters of callcode of
Originator’s location
<destination> AAA First three letters of destination
Surname/code
<destination location> oe First three letters of callcode of
destination location
<flags> AAA A set of three letter codes describing

message priority, etc.

#### 10.2 Message ident Flags
The following is a limited sub-seq of the availabie message flags.

Note: Some flags are mutually exclusive. These are shown grouped and bracketed.

 

 

Let Personal Letter

MEM Memo

MES General Message

ORD Orders

OTH Other Message

aor Report

UNC Unclassified (default)

CON Confidential

CLA Classified

SEC secret

TOP Top Secret

OTH Other Classification

DEL Transmission original erased (default) |
DUP Archive Duplicate kept
CCP Copies sent to other parties
PRI Priority Message

#### 10.3 Comnet Path

The Comnet Path is a machine readable list of all the nodes a message has passed
through, used tor backtracking, replies and verification. Each entry in the list has the
format:

AAA-NNNN.N

which is the abbreviated form of the node’s ComNet |IDent. The ComNet |Dent is not
covered further as its usage is beyong the scope of this text.

#### 10.4 Example

An example of a valid Message ID and Comnet Path is shown below. The normal
Message Header is included for reference.
