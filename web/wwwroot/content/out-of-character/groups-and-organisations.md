### THE BROTHERHOOD

"Fanatics, who blame the CMS for everything that they
consider immoral and wrong with the universe/society.
They claim to fight for a variety of ‘worthy' causes,
including independance for all planets; their own
religion - especially since the One True Church was
officially recognised as the main religion; racial;
against the corporate domination of most world economies;
and on the fringes of human colonisation they fight for
the ownership of planets, and effectively their human
population."

From "A Brief Guide to History"

The Brotherhood are essentially a terrorist organisation, who
claim to fight the repression of the United Worlds (UW) and
especially what is effectively their military arm, the CMS.

Their beliefs seem to change to suit the circumstances, and
they can often be hired by anyone for a wide variety of
purposes, although not with any great degree of
trustworthiness.

Many of their motives are not easy to understand, and they
are difficult to predict due to their volatile nature. They
can get righteously and loudly upset if they are accused of
anything, and are not adverse to complaining to the UW about
‘acts of injustice and complicity’ oon the part of the CMS or
certain corporations. |

Rumour has it that several major corporations) actively
support the Brotherhood, although whether this is merely to
keep them off of their own worlds is not clear.

Although on the face of it the Brotherhood do not seem to
pose too much of ae threat, they should never be
underestimated. They are cruel, viscious, cunning and deadly,
with access to an impressive array of weaponry.

The Brotherhood had an unofficial moratorium on the use of
projectile weapons, a self-imposed ban that they had adherred
to until recently. They have submitted evidence to the Uw,
claiming that they were actually fired upon by such weapons,
wielded by Colonial Marines on the planet Golgotha. This is
doubly embarassing to the UW, as Golgotha is owned by Iowa
Power, who have since asked for an official explanation of
the CMC's unauthorised presence.

A second complaint has been submitted to the UW - that’ the
CMC deliberately unleashed a deadly virus on Altair IV. Both
matters are now under review by the UW, who have called for
extensive investigations into the activities of CMC 5th
Company.


### PURITANS

"Rabid xenophobes, who seek the destruction of all those
who are not truely human - i.e. all mutated humans (e.g.
the Urthankoi, races with other ‘impure’ traits such as
pointed ears, etc). Such races are regarded as
abominations, and should be destroyed before infecting
the rest of civilisation!"

From 'A Brief Guide to History’

The Puritans have perfected the art of bigotry and racism to
an unsurpassed degree. They can find their roots’ among
religious zealots of the past, idealistic patriotic groups,
and even the ancient Klan from Earth. Over the years, the
hatred of all things not ‘made in the image of God' evolved
from merely differing skin colours, into a movement against
those who had been born with ‘imperfections’ asa result of
radiation poisoning (IR as well as nuclear).

Races such as the Urthankoi, whilst originally of human
stock, are regarded by the Puritans as the work of the Devil,
and thus abominations that should be wiped out before
infecting the rest of the human race. Other hated targets
include genetically altered life forms, clones, and even
those colonists who suffered from slight mutations due to
back-ground IR or the harsh environment of their new worlds.

Puritans have contacts in the United Worlds (UW), several
colonies (strictly monitored for any ‘'abominations') on outer
worlds, and are also rumoured to have an interest in several
major corporations.

They are also the subject of a CMS investigation, following
the murder of a Luthusian family on Chi Draconis.

Puritans maintain a rigid system of government and population
control, with each new-born child having to pass a Normality
examination. Successful babies are given a Pure Birth
Certificate (PBC), the others are - according to official
sources - sterilised, branded with the Deviant'’s Mark and
then exiled from the planet, often being sold into slavery
(where legal). There are, however, many who claim that such
unfortunates are in fact murdered to prevent the potential
infection of proper 'God fearing’ citizens. There has never
been enough proof of such killings to allow the UW to
initiate an official investigation.


### I.F.C. (INDEPENDANCE FOR CLONES)

"IFC supporters campaign for rights for clones, whom to
date are legally regarded as being the property of the
organisation who funded their 'growth'".

from "A Brief Guide to History"

Clones are beings that are generated from the genetic code of
human donors. Embryonic beings are matured in an artificial
womb, and after a simulated birth process are brought up as
normal children.

Most clones are undistinguishable from their human ‘brothers’
- although it is supposed that some large corporations are
currently experimenting with the alteration of genetic code
in an attempt to produce ‘custom designed' clones.

Eminent genetics scientist Tanki Lee Ho (United Worlds)
recently described research into 'perfect' beings as exciting
and breath-taking, but he also warned against companies
attempting to 'play God' and twisting the miracle of creation
into an evil mockery of life.

The IFC movement was started by Angus McCall, who was the son
an Iowa Power Corporate Board Member. When he was 16, his
brother was forcibly removed by men in Corporate Security
uniforms, and was dragged away kicking and screaming. Angus
turned to their father for help, but he turned his back as if
nothing was happening. His father told him to forget James,
saying that he had never had a brother, James wasn't human -
and he didn't have the right to a name anymore... Angus never
saw his brother again.

Ever since then, he has campaigned for rights for clones,
claiming that as it is impossible to distinguish between
humans and their brothers, then why are they regarded as two
totally seperate legal entities.

Members of the IFC are suspected to be behind the
‘liberation’ of hundreds of clones from various corporations
over the last few years, but nothing has ever pointed to
McCall himself. It is rumoured that several undercover
security teams have been sent to Kidnap him, but to date he
has managed to avoid detection.
His last public appearance was at Port Delluse on Insulon
Iii, at which he uttered the following:

"Clones are as real as you and I. They feel the same emotions
that we do, they have the same hopes and dreams, they grow
Old and die, just as we their human brothers do.

Why is it that they have no rights whatsoever? They
cannot vote, have children, own possessions, or make any sort
of choice about their own future.

Possibly the cruellest aspect of a clone's life comes when
with no warning whatsoever, he or she is torn away from their
family, and stripped of their very identity.

They can be beaten and even be slaughtered like animals, but
they have no right of self defence, and the perpetrators
cannot be prosecuted. There are laws to regulate the
treatment of livestock, but there's sod all for our brothers.
They are legally regarded as property - a commodity that can
be bought or sold, and disposed of without the slightest
thought.

They are lied to for most of their life, and treated like
shit for the rest of it.

Is this how we should treat our brothers?...

And we call ourselves humane..."

### THE HENGISTS

"A selection of crackpots and drop-outs, who believe that
aliens control the destiny of all things. They are
convinced that aliens are the 'missing link' in our
evolutionary chain, following inter-breeding between the
aliens and human ancestors. Their name is derived from
the site of Stonehenge on Terra (Earth), which they
regard as having been built to mark the spot where aliens
first landed."

From "A Brief Guide to History"

Hengists come from all walks of life, from asteroid miners to
Corporate Board Members. They are a harmless organisation,
who simply watch the distant horizons for any sign of the
Makers.

Every momentous event in mankind's history is - according to
them - attributable to the Makers, who first discovered
humans when we were still running around clubbing things to
death with dinosaur bones. The Makers adopted us as their
children, and gifted us with their seed, thus it is they who
are the ‘missing link'.

Their name is derived from that of the fabled first landing
site of the Makers on Earth - Stonehenge, in Europe. Hengists
tend mainly to have been born away from Earth, a fact which
has kept many a philosophical student busy over the years.

The Hengists do not have much of a hierarchy, as all members
are of equal status, and are free to do much as they wish.
Any incidence of Maker contact or evidence of past
visitations is routed immediately through the Chronicallers,
who are based on Earth. It is, of course, still every
person's legal responsibility to report any of the above to
the United Worlds (UW).

several Hengists can usually be found amongst terra-forming
teams, and also in colony out-posts in the far corners of the
spread of civilisation.

They are still mainly regarded as eccentrics and drop-outs,
despite the varying nature of their membership, but’ the
Makers made disbelievers for a purpose, so they bear such
comments with remarkable understanding.


### L.A.W. (LEAGUE AGAINST WARFARE )

"Peace demonstrators and pacifists, whose beliefs have
not stopped them from blowing up military installations,
with the subsequent loss of both military and civilian
life."

From ‘A Brief Guide to History'

The League was formed by Zandra Constella - a famous) actress
of her time - who gained the support of a rash of famous
personalities for her uni-galactical peace movement. Their
Original aims were to raise the public awareness of the
dangers of modern warfare, by means of sit-ins, public
rallies, and personal visits to the more influencial
core-worlds. Over the years however, the League's membership
has come to support the use of violent means to achieve their
aims.

They have claimed responsibility for hundreds of attacks’ on
military and United Worlds (UW) installations, and have been
implicated in countless others. The recent and most worrying
trend has been the bombing of such sites where there is a
high public presence. Over 150 civilians have died as a
result of such attacks; just under half of those were
children, most of whom perished when their school was hit by
a missile that had been deflected by the defence-system of
its intended target.

The League still claim to be pacifists, whose only aim is to
rid the stars of the threat of war, but for every peace
demonstration they hold, they commit at least three bombing
raids.

It is clear that that the League are being funded by at least
two major corporations, but despite intensive inquiries their
identities (and motives) have yet to be discovered.

Membership of the LAW is a criminal offence under current UW
legislation. It is also illegal to habour LAW members, and to
provide financial - or any other form of - support.


### THE NU PHOENICIANS

Mercanaries, with a strong code of ‘honour' and a
terrible accent. From the mercenary world Nu Phoenicia.
