# The Colonial Marine Corps - February 1999 Newsletter.

Greetings Marines.

## 'Operation Dawn' - January 2502 

This  was a great success, marred by the sad loss of two members of the 
Company, Lieutenant Joel Turner and Spec1 Olaf Peterson. Those present on 
the mission are still involved in a play-by-email game covering their 
adventures as they leave planet. (For those who weren't there, various 
problems resulted in the Garavaglia having to leave without picking up the 
Marines, so everybody has to find their own way back to the rallying 
point!)

## Next Mission

The next mission will be held on 14-16 May 1999, at a new site just off 
the A1 to the north of Harrogate (this is the site Tony has been enthusing 
about!). Bookings are now open, please send a ukp 20 deposit to Tony Gill 
(cheques payable to 'N.E. Gill') to reserve your place. Monsters are also 
required, please contact Tony. New recruits are welcome, please contact 
Mexal when you book your place so that we can start on creating your 
character prior to the mission.

## Planetary Ownership

This programme is developing nicely. The following planets have been 
'adopted' by the named person, please contact them if your character comes 
from there and/or if you'd like to contribute to the development of 
background material for that planet: -

* Alpha Centauri - Joel Hammond-Turner
* Barnard's Star - Andy Johnson
* Chi Draconis - Andy Brown
* Kruger - Ian Russell
* Liane - Dave Lowry

There are plenty more planets available - please ask Mexal for a copy of 
the full list of 'thumbnail sketches' of planets known to us - or you are 
welcome to create your own planet and submit it for inclusion.

## The 'Trained Marine Programme'

In developing a structured career path for Marines, the 'Trained Marine 
Programme' has been set up as the next stage after Basic Training. Once a 
recruit has attended his first mission (during which he will undergo Basic 
Training and field training, and by the end will be passed out as a 
trained Marine), he should begin to work his way through all the Level-4 
training courses available - he is not required to qualify in all of them, 
but should be aware of their contents - and, once a test has been 
satisfactorily completed, will be eligible for promotion to Marine First 
Class and to embark on training for the speciality of his choice.

The Level-4 courses currently available are: -

* Armourer, EODTech, Intel, MedTech, NBCTech, Sursat Tech - please ask Mexal 
for a copy of the notes.
* Radio Operator - please ask Joel Hammond-Turner for a 
copy.
* Patrolling - please ask Mikey Gearing for a 
copy.

At present, copies are distributed by email or post, but the intention is 
to make them available on the website in due course.

## Personal News

Congratulations to Joel Hammond-Turner on his engagement to Vicky.

## Other Developments

The long-awaited monetary system is being developed - at last Marine pay 
will no longer be a myth! And those of you who wish to gamble or run 
sweepstakes will have something to lose other than your shirts.

## Websites
Andy Johnson's personal website includes a nice picture of Captain Calvin 
in uniform, and OOC copies of the Captain's mission reports. Andy says 
that Marines are welcome to read them, but must remember that these are 
Classified Documents and access is strictly Out Of Character. Anyone 
caught referring to the reports In Character will be deemed to have been 
poking around in databases without authorisation, and will be dealt with 
accordingly! The website is at http://www.ajohnson.demon.co.uk

Those of you who would like to try other Live Role Playing events might 
care to look at the Adventurers' Guild website 
(http://www.phoenix.co.uk/ag) where there are comprehensive event listings 
- fantasy, horror, contemporary, vampire and more.

## Mailing Lists

You are all welcome to join the CMC-OOC mailing list. Discussions include 
system development and ideas, anything Marine-related, really. The CMC-IC 
mailing list is reserved (for security reasons) to those people who have 
attended at least one Mission since last October.

To join a list, send an email to 'listserver@phoenix.co.uk with

subscribe cmc-ooc OR subscribe cmc-ic

in the body of the message.

That's all for now - get your bookings in for May and let's make it a 
great event!

Hugs and kisses,

TechSgt Mexal.
