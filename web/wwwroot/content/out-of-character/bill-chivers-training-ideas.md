Dear Tony,

I have been giving some thought as to how we the players could improve the
organisation of the unit. I think one way forward would be for DH to delegate as much as the
'time in’ running of the unit as possible to the players. Here are a few ideas that have been
kicking around in my head.

1. I think that we should move towards the players carrying out as much of the training
as possible. This would require the creation of an instructional skill. I have roughed out a
system for instructors ratings (its loosely based on the ratings system we have in Aviation):

I think that the system needs to be fairly restrictive on the players for several reasons.
Firstly, its important that the skill training is carried out really properly. Secondly, we don't want
an overabundance of instructors or this will encourage power play as everbody becomes
skilled at everything.

The system I have designed deals with this in two ways. Firstly an instructors rating
is not a ‘ticket to ride’ as the play will be overseen from above. Secondly the system requires
that you are in current teaching practice on a subject in order to be allowed to teach it again.
This will put an effective upper limit on the number of skills which a given instructor could
teach of around 5 or 6. This should mean that instructors will develop into specialists in
perhaps 2 areas rather than being Jack of all trades.

2. Qualifications

 

In order to carry out traifiifg, aMindividual must be suitably qualified. An instructor
requires two things: a instrudiges, Rating and a Skill Rating.

 

The first of these, the instruct rs
in instructional techniques.

The second, the skill rating, shows that the individual Is specifically qualified in the
content of a particular course of training carried out in the OMC.

 

: ating, shows that the individual is generally qualified

 

é.g. Sgt Bloggs has the following skills:

Medtech - 4

Armourer - 4

Sniper - 4

Instructor - 4 (with the conawanng skill ratings: Atmourer 4, Sniper 4)

Sergeant Bloggs can use the skills of Arméurer 4 and Sniper 4 as well as teach them,
but he can not teach medtech 4 even though he can act as a medic himself.

 

3. instructors Ratings - Initial issue, Privileges, Period of Validity & Ri
3.1.‘ Instructor 4 (Assistant Instructor)
a. Initial Issue
To qualify as an Instructor 4 the candidate must:
- undergo a course of training.
- complete a test of competancy.
- These must both be carried out by am Instructor Examiner (level 2 or better).
b. Privileges
An Instructor 4 may teach a course under the supervision of a more senior instructor.
The supervisor doesn't have to be present at all times but should be keeping a fairly

close eye on things to make sure that the course is being properly conducted.

An Instructor 4 may not sign off a skill as having been taught, this must be done by
the supervising Instructor.

3.3

Period Of Validity & Revalidation
An Instructor 4 is subject to revalidation at 6 monthly intervals. This comprises running
a complete course in the presence of an Instructor Examiner (level 2 or better). If the

examiner feels that the standard of the course is good enough then the candidate may
also be raised to Instructor 3.

Instructor 3 (Qualified Instructor)
Initial Issue
To qualify as an Instructor 3 the candidate must have:
- at least 6 months experience as an assistant Instructor (level 4).
- run at least 4 course of training as an assistant instructor (level 4).
- exhibited a high standard of instructional ability.
- exhibited the judgement required to supervise assistant instructors.
- These attributes will be assessed during a practical test carried out by an
Instructor Examiner, this may be carried out at the same time as a normal
revalidation.
Privileges
An Instructor 3 may
- carry out training without any immediate supervision.
- act as the supervisor required by an Instructor 4.
Period Of Validity & Revalidation
An instructor 3 is subject to revalidation by an Instructor 2 or 1, but this is only required
at 12 monthly intervals.
Instructor 2 (Instructor Examiner)
Initial Issue
Assessment for qualification as an Instructor 2 is done on a case by case basis. The

minimum level of experience which is considered appropriate is 2 years in post as an
Instructor 3. Selection is carried out by a board of Instructor 1's.
3.4

Privileges

An Instructor 2 may
- carry out training without any immediate supervision.
- act as the supervisor required by an Instructor 4.
- carry out training to qualify candidates as Instructor 4.

- carry out revalidation tests for Instructors 3 and 4.
- upgrade Instructor 4's to Instructor 3.

Period Of Validity & Revalidation

An instructor 2 is subject to revalidation by an Instructor 1 at 12 monthly
intervals.

Instructor 1 (Senior Instructor Examiner)
Initial Issue

Assessment for qualification as an Instructor 1 is done on a case by case basis. The
minimum level of experience which is considered appropriate is 2 years in post as an
Instructor 2. Selection is carried out by a board of Instructor 1's.

Privileges
An Instructor 1 may

- carry out training without any immediate supervision.
- act as the supervisor required by an Instructor 4.

- carry out training to qualify candidates as Instructor 4.
- carry out revalidation tests for Instructors 2,3 and 4.

- upgrade Instructor 4's to Instructor 3.

Period Of Validity

An instructor 1 is subject to revalidation by an Instructor 1 at 12 monthly
intervals.
4. Skill Ratings

Carrying Out Instruction

In addition to having a properly validation as an instructor (as detailed above), an
individual must also recieve specific training in the skills to be taught. This is known
as a Skill rating and is carried out by an Instructor 3 or better (note that in this
instance an instructor 3 can teach an instructor 1). The candidate must already
possess the skill in question and must have held it for at least 3 months. This skill
rating itself consists of the candidate observing the whole course being taught and
then teaching the whole course under direct supervision (this may need to be carried
out over 2 weekends). The skill rating instructor then signs off a Certificate Of
Experience for the rating which allows the candidate to teach the skill.

A certificate of experience for a skill rating is valid for a period of 6 months.
A skill rating can be renewed as follows:

If, during the 6 months of validity of the certificate of experience the course has been
taught, all that is necessary is to provide documentary evidence to any equal or higher
instructor. That instructor can then sign a certificate of experience revalidating the skill
rating for a further 6 months.

On the other hand, if the skill has not been taught during the 6 month period then the
skill rating in question lapses and can not be used. It may be regained in 2 ways:

‘ By re-doing the skill rating in the original way under an instructor 3 or better.

2. by choosing that skill as the sample exercise for the content of the revalidation
test for the whole instructors rating, as long as the examiner has the appropriate skill
rating.

5. Administration

An instructor would keep a log of their own certificates of test (for their instructors
ratings) and certificates of experience (for their skill ratings). I will produce some standard
forms for this. Additionally the instructor is responsible for keeping a log of the courses which
are run, the students which attend it and the results. If somebody screws up in the field, the
instructor which taught them can expect some grief, possibly the removal of the skill rating in
question.
Note for Tony & Mike:

I really aimed to make it difficult to be an instructor in more than 3 skills or so. Hence
the requirement for the skill ratings which can only be easily renewed if the skill is taught at
least once every six months. If a player comes every month and runs a course every month
then they could just about keep 6 skill ratings going. I think this would tend to help keep the
system under control.

How to implement the system. I hope to talk to you both about this, but in case I don't,
I envisage that there would be a fair number of Instructor 4's in the regular players but only
a very small number of instructor 3's (perhaps 2 or 3, or enough to make sure that there will
be one available most weekends). PC's should not be able to ‘grow their own’ instructors and
would therefore not get selected for instructor 2 other than in special circumstances. I see
Zwalf as an Instructor 2, who is revalidating as required ‘behind the scenes’ between missions.
Any NPCs who needs to teach something would just have the minimum qualification to do so.

As far as introducing the system, if you deem it suitable, I have an ‘In game’ idea for
justifying it which I will tell you about if you so wish.

OTHER IDEAS

I have some other ideas which I have not has time to develop yet. Tony, we have
talked briefly about some of them. I will just list ideas here.

Dispatches _I think this is the name of the in house unit newsletter? Get it going again and
publish routine orders etc in it as well.

Staff Posts

Junior officers / Officer cadets taking responsibilty for certain areas of running the unit.
Personnel Officer

- Time Out: Report to Tony?

- Time In: Report to Unit Executive Officer.

- Establish and maintain a system of personnel records. I have started work on
a standard record which would centralise all the data required by the unit about
each marine. Please find attached the work so far. Where possible the form is
filled in for my character but some sections are not appropriate (for example
he has no skills) so I have made up representative ficticious data).

- In particular, have a summary of name, rank and skills of the players for each
event to allow CO to decide on team/squad organisation before Time In.

- Interview marines to develop character backgrounds, liase with DH staff Time
Out to determine if a suggested background is appropriate. If we all develop
more comprehensive backgrounds not only will it make the overall feel even
better but we may find scenario ideas as a consequence. PS Tony please look
at Oslos background and see if that is OK.

- Liase with Dispatches? to place a 'POSTED IN' notice for experienced
marines starting new characters to allow everyone to know the new arrivals
background.

- Liase with Dispatches / Interstella regarding Obituaries.
‘Se.

Training Officer
- Time Out: Report to Mike?
- Time In: Report to Unit Executive Officer?
- To canvass marines to see what advanced courses they want to do. I know
this has been done already but I know that in my case I wanted to do nearly
all of them! So if we repeat the exercise but ask them to list in order of desire
then we might be better off.
- To liase with Personnel Officer and CO to determine which advanced courses
should be a priority.
- Liase with unit instructors to determine course availability.
- Establish a medium term training plan with the aim being a gradual across the
board increase in skills rather than any sudden ‘Big Bang’.
- Liase with higher authority to provide instructor training if unit instructors
inadequate for the training task.
- Liase with Dispatches to publish all advanced courses successes.
- Organise-refresher training as required.
- Organise competitions to foster -excellance in all areas. For example,
orienteering, night nav, codebreaking, shooting, + anything and everything else!
